#####Life Story of Ellen Precinda Moffett Done
*As related to her daughter Olive Done Hall in 1960*

Though I never saw my maternal grandfather, I was born on his
fifty-ninth birthday, May 14, 1883, in the little Mormon
settlement of St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona. This was a
far cry from his birthplace in Boone County, Kentucky, and
many miles from his home, then in Southern Utah.

My parents, Joseph Ammon and Olive Catherine Emmett Moffett,
with a second wife, Annie Maria Johnson Moffett, were advised by
Church Authorities to move from their home in Eden, Weber County,
Utah, to Arizona, because of severe persecution by the law against
those practicing plural marriage. They started this tiresome
wagon journey in November of 1881, arriving at St. Johns on December
23 of that same year.

Before leaving Utah my mother had had two children: Joseph
Armstead, born September 6, 1877, in Ogden; died September 2, 1879,
in Eden, and Olive Della, born April 14, 1880, in Salt Lake City.
My Aunt Maria had one child: Benjamin Ammon, born October 16, 1881, in Eden.

The new home was not to be enjoyed for long, as persecution
followed very soon. One month after my birth, Aunt Maria gave
birth to another child, Ella Maria, born June 14, 1883. Early
in 1885 we contracted scarlet fever. Ella Maria died, and
I was still a very sick child when we started on our trek to
Old Mexico, where my parents, in company with several other Mormon
families, hoped to find a haven of peace where they could raise
their families and worship God as they desired. They commenced
this journey in February of 1885.

Before many days it became apparent that I was too ill to travel. The
company made camp and my mother kept a prayerful, anxious vigil all
one day and night while Aunt Maria prepared hot packs over the camp
fire to keep me breathing. In the evening Bishop Hunt and several other
men of the camp came and administered to me. He promised that I should
recover. By morning I was much better, and able to take a little broth
made from a wild duck one of the boys had killed.

Soon the company was again on its way. By the end of March we had
reached a place called San Jose, some twenty miles south of the town
of Coroletos, in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico. Here my father
announced he would make camp for some time, and, on April 2, 1885,
Aunt Maria's baby girl, Laura Ann, was born in a wagon box, on the
banks of the Casas Grande River, just across from where the town of
Dublan was later established.

By this time the company was out of provisions and money. The children
needed milk, so my parents traded their sewing machine for a cow.
The Mexicans had little besides beans, corn and wheat. They had their
wheat in stacks, threshing out a little at a time with a flail and
cleaning it in the wind. The men heard of a thresher that had been
brought in the year before, but never used as no one knew how to
operate it. The owner was glad to turn it over to the Mormons. It
was in very bad condition, but my father had had some experience
in his father's blacksmith shop and had worked on threshers. Before
long the machine was repaired and the men went to work threshing all
the wheat in the valley. They took their pay in wheat, thus providing
bread for the little company for the first year.

While waiting for instructions from President A. F. McDonald, then in
Mexico City, to make purchase of land for them to settle on, the
officials of the State of Chihuahua became alarmed through rumors that
these Mormons had been driven out of their own country because of ill
behavior. They immediately issued orders for their expulsion, giving
them only three days to leave. This was in April of 1885. The little
company was deeply concerned, for it was in no condition to make a
return journey.

Apostle George Teasdale came to their rescue. With my father and Isaac
Turley as teamsters and cooks, he drove to the nearest telegraph station
and sent an urgent wire to President McDonald.

Before they left, Apostle Teasdale suggested that the company fast and
pray on the morrow, Sunday. The Sabbath dawned bright and fair. The
little group gathered under the trees and sang songs, then knelt in a
circle in the sand. Several prayers were offered. While they were still
on their knees my mother put her hands down in the sand and pressed
it close. A thrill passed through her being and a testimony was given
to her that the Mormons would not have to leave Mexico. A feeling
of gratitude and love for the land and its people came to her. She
bowed her head to the earth, pressed her face to the soft sand and
kissed it. Although they passed through much privation, sickness and
sorrow, this assurance remained with her, giving her hope and
courage to go on.

Three days later the men returned, bringing word that they might remain,
and that the land had been purchased for their colony.

My brother Junius was born June 24, 1885, while the company was
still camped on the banks of the Casas Grande River. It was a
stormy night and the wind often blew out the only light they had -- a
candle down in the bottom of an olla. My mother and her baby
were drenched with the rain several times during the five days
she remained in bed, but she did not fear. She knew her Heavenly
Father had promised to care for his daughters in childbearing.
