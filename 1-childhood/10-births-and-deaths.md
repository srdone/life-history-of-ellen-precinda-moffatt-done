One morning at the breakfast table my father looked over our meager fare of cornmeal mush and very little milk. He was discouraged and the thought came to him, "After all, is this worth blessing?" Quickly he pushed the ugly thought from his mind. and had one of the children ask the blessing. At noon, up in the mountains where he was cutting fence posts, he paused to eat his lunch, a piece of corn bread and a bit of milk, when the same ugly thought came again. As he took the small bottle of milk out, it slipped from his hand, breaking and spilling the milk on the ground. In great humility he ate his dry corn bread, feeling that he had been justly punished for his ingratitude. That evening he told us of these happenings and we all felt more thankful for what we had, realizing it could be much less.

I was baptized in the river that ran through the Pacheco Valley, in a pool surrounding a large black rock. This was our swimming pool, and I remember the fun we used to have sliding down that big slick rock and splashing down into the water.

One day Father found some saleratus in a cave. This came in very handy. It could be used in the place of baking soda which was hard to get. We hadn't had any for a long time.

Our Pacheco school wasn't doing very well, and when home missionaries visited from Colonia Juarez, they suggested that families with children of school age send them to the Juarez school. This was a great hardship and added expense. Ben and Della were placed in the Stowell home in Juarez. They had been there only a short time when a grandchild of the Stowells died of typhoid fever. The corpse was brought to their home, consequently Ben and Della were taken out of school. Della was asked to stand watch by the dead child while the others had their dinner. Being alone in that room proved too much for her. She went into nervous chills from the shock and later ran a fever which developed into typhoid. Her parents were sent for. She partially recovered from the typhoid, but a dropsical condition developed from which she died, January 24, 1893, after the family had moved back to Juarez.

While still in Pacheco, we were with Mother in the garden one morning when we saw a horseman riding toward us. Mother said, "He brings bad news." Sure enough, he told of the Indian Massacre at the Thompson Ranch. A group of Indians, mostly squaws, had come down and, finding Sister Thompson alone with her children, they killed her and her oldest son and wounded another son who hid in the chicken coop with his little sister until they were gone.

They made their way to their nearest neighbors, three miles away to report the tragedy.

Father soon decided to leave the mountains. He bought a lot in Juarez, with a small house, orchard and grape vineyard on it. They felt that traveling up and down those mountains and having their children away from home to attend school cost much more than it was worth.

During the year of 1893 Father hauled lumber from the mountains and built a home for Aunt Maria. It was at this time her little son Willard was kicked in the bowels by a horse. He lay at the point of death for almost a month, then became a little better for about two years. He did so want to be baptized. He lived only two months after his eighth birthday, long enough to realize his great desire.

On September 15, 1893 Mother gave birth to a baby girl. The next day, September l6 Aunt Maria also gave birth to a baby girl. They named them Verdie Myrtle and Verna May. Mother's little Verdie only lived a year. She died of inflamation of the bowels on September 19, 1894.

We enjoyed going to school. The teachers were fine and the schoolhouse so much nicer than we had ever seen before. It was fun to have so many other children to play with, and to attend Sunday School, Primary and Church regularly. It was so nice to have enough children of our own ages to make classes so much more interesting.

Times were more prosperous for us now and we were very happy in our little home. How we enjoyed the fruits from our orchard and vineyard! There were peaches early, late, and in between, so we ate to our heart's content and had plenty left to bottle and dry for use in winter.

Father had his leg broken by a caving bank. The ankle was also thrown out of joint. It was never set properly and gave him a great deal of trouble all the rest of his life.
