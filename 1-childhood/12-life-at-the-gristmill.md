In December of 1895 Father and Mother moved with their family to Galeana where he rented and ran a grist mill for the Ponce brothers. Here Mother worked and earned enough money to get herself a set of false teeth.

While there we were all troubled with chills and fever and some of us suffered from this illness for many years. We enjoyed boating on the millpond, as well as swimming in it, but these pleasures probably added to, if they were not the whole cause of our chills and fever.

We raised a large flock of geese and saved the down and feathers to replenish our bedding.

The grist mill was always fascinating to us, and we spent many hours watching the wheat being ground into flour. Once, when the mill burrs became dull and in need of sharpening, Mr. Ponce, the owner, wanted Father to send to Juarez for a Brother Ballinger to come, as he was an expert at sharpening such things. It seemed no one else but Junius could be spared. He was only ten and Mother felt he was much too young and inexperienced to make the more than forty mile journey alone on horseback, but, under the circumstances she reluctantly consented.

Mr. Ponce furnished the horse and Junius started out in the early hours of the morning so he could get to Juarez by afternoon. But the horse was slow and, as the miles stretched out he became slower, paying no heed to the urgings of the small anxious boy on his back.

It was after dark when he finally got to Juarez and delivered his message to Brother Ballinger. He then rode to Aunt Maria's. Finding the house in darkness, he decided not to awaken them. He sat on the ditch bank, keeping hold of the horse's reins, and waited for morning.

He was asleep when his Aunt awakened that morning. She was startled to see a man and horse so near her back door. Presuming it was a tramp, she was about to set her dog on him when he awakened and yelled to her not to let the dog bite him.

She listened to his story and realized that Father and Mother would be worried if he did not get home by afternoon. Brother Ballinger could not return with him as had been expected, so Aunt Maria gave him a hurried breakfast and sent him on his way.

No one had even thought of the poor horse who hadn't had any feed since leaving home the morning before. The journey back began to tell on the poor animal that wasn't equal to the trip in the first place. His slow pace of the day before became much slower until he finally stopped entirely, laid down and refused to get up. Junius was really in trouble. Out on this sparsely traveled road with several Mexican settlements between him and home, he dreaded to leave the horse, but dared not leave the saddle, as the Mexicans would surely take it and he would be blamed for its loss. He did the only thing he felt he could do. He began his weary journey on foot, trying to carry and drag the heavy saddle.

Meanwhile, Mother felt that her son was in danger and became more worried as the day dragged on. Finally she had Father load the wagon with flour and produce they were intending to take to Juarez later, placed her younger children on the load and started out to meet Junius.

He was indeed a weary and discouraged youngster when we came upon him, still trying to carry that heavy saddle. Mother felt thankful she had come as he would have been in great danger had he met with unscrupulous Mexicans who would have taken the saddle from him and probably harmed or even killed him when he resisted them. We went on to Juarez, delivered our load and returned home safely.

We made many trips between Glaeana and Juarez, some pleasant and some not so pleasant.

One particular trip we were met by Mexicans who told us the usual road was washed out and practically impassable and that we had better take the longer way. Soon a terrible storm arose. The team suddenly stopped at the top of a hill. Mother found one of the wheels was lodged against a large stump. It was dark and there was nothing to do but camp for the night. We ate a cold supper, prayed for God's protection, and settled down for the night. The sacks of flour didn't make the softest of beds, but the canvas overhead kept us dry and morning finally came. Mother could see plainly that God's protection had been over us in causing the team to stop where they did, as the road ahead was in such a condition she could not have driven it in the dark without upsetting the load or getting stuck in the deep, muddy gullies.

She sent the boys to ask some Mexicans to bring their horses and help us out. They came with the most pitiful horses we had ever seen. Finally, after much work they were able to get us on our way, and went to their homes rejoicing over their payment of a sack of flour.

One morning Mother led in family prayer. As usual I was following the prayer in my mind as we had been taught to do. It seemed she prayed more earnestly than ever that we be protected that day from dangers seen and unseen.

This sentence came to my mind several times during the day. Along in the afternoon I was whittling. The knife slipped and struck deep in under my eyebrow; just above the eyeball. The blood began to spurt, I screamed, and Mother came to my rescue. At first she feared I had put out my eye, but, on closer examination, she found the blade had barely missed the eyeball. Then we gave thanks to God for heeding our humble prayers of that morning and giving the protection Mother had asked for so earnestly.

In the fall we were feeling better from the malaria. Father built a small fireplace in one corner of the kitchen which threw its welcome warmth out and around the room. Many pleasant evenings were spent around it. We roasted sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes and onions in the coals, and barbecued bits of meat, dough, and other tasty tidbits on forked sticks over the flames.

By winter we left Galeana, moving back to Juarez. Father and Aunt Maria went to Chihuahua City to work in a hotel with Brother and Sister Lucian Meacham. Mother's daughter, Zelnora, was born April 21, 1896, while Father and Aunt Maria were still away.
