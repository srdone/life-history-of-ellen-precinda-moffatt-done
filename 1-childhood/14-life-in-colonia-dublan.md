Soon we moved to Dublan, a rather new settlement, situated on the railroad line that had just been completed from El Paso, Texas to the sawmill community of Madera, Chihuahua, Mexico. The little town was growing. Father sold his property in Juarez and bought a farm above Dublan.

Aunt Maria's son Jedediah was born January 4, 1897, after she was settled in her new home in Dublan, and just before Mother's family moved there.

On this farm we planted our crops where the Lamanites of hundreds of years before had lived and farmed. Proof of this was to be found through relics we found in the freshly plowed earth. Pieces of pottery, mostly broken, but on occasion we found one in perfect condition. One day, while digging, we uncovered a string of blue beads. They lay there looking almost perfect until we attempted to pick them up. The string was completely rotted away and the beads crumbled at our touch. This was on what we called the 'upper farm', about five miles south of Dublan proper. Father and the boys farmed the land, but the two families lived in town most of the time.

The years passed happily. We had our fun along with our work. Hay rides in the moonlight, picnics along the river, under the large cottonwood trees, dances, parties and 'home talent' theaters gave spice to pioneer life.

One day while the family was out on the prairie Father spotted a swarm of bees clinging to a fence post. Mother took off one of her half slips and tied it securely together at the waist. Father slipped it cautiously over the tees and fastened the skirt around the post with a piece of baling wire, 'Mormon 'buckskin' as it was called. He then dug up the post and, holding it upright in the wagon, proceeded home with our treasure. Father had attempted to capture a swarm of bees near home not long before this, but they had flown away while he was making them a suitable hive. This time the hive was ready and the bees seemed very content with their new home. By catching other runaway swarms and buying some, Father built up quite an apiary. We always had bees after this.

We had a chance at a little more schooling in Dublan, but, because of illness and many other interferences, I had never seemed to develop a liking for school. Brother Paul Cardon and his wife, Ella, were fine teachers. Sister Bertha Pratt was also one of the early teachers. Her teaching career there covered a duration of forty years or more, with the exception of time out for the birth of her babies, and a few years when all the people were away from their homes following the Exodus.

Mother's last child was born February 5, 1900, a daughter. They named her Lula Rozella. In the fall of that same year Aunt Maria's son Joseph Franklin was born, November 1, 1900.

One evening while Lula was still very tiny, Father was holding her while the other children were playing nearby. The baby scratched herself with her fingernails and began to cry. Father playfully said, as he comforted her, "Now listen wee, young lady, we'll just have to trim those fingernails if you persist in being so mean to yourself with them."

Little ears were wide open, especially those of four-year-old Zelnora. The next day she heard the baby crying and presumed she had scratched herself again. Those fingernails must be trimmed! Armed with a large pair of shears, she began the task. Luckily for all concerned, her first attempt at cutting the nails of her tiny sister brought lusty howls and Mother came to the rescue before any harm was done.

Father wanted to spank Zelnora, but Mother would not let him. She told him that the remark of the evening before had been overheard by the child who would never have thought of doing such a thing by herself. This episode made us all more careful what we said in front of younger children, and many times since I have thought twice before punishing a child for something it might have done innocently because of a careless remark from an older person.

Soon after the settlement of Dublan, the people decided to build a reservoir and canal from the river to store water for irrigation purposes. The valley was examined and a likely spot located near the east hills was chosen. It had three good-sized low places which seemed perfect for lakes. Next they surveyed for the canal, locating the likeliest line for this purpose.

When excavations began the men were greatly surprised to find that people, before our time, had built canals along the very route now chosen, and that the 'lakes' they intended to use for water storage had stored water for these prehistoric peoples, the Nephites and Lamanites, of ancient times.

The soil in this valley is porous clay and soaks up water quickly, but these 'lakes' hold water well to this day. Many wondered about this until some archeologist, exploring the country, discovered that they were lined with a non-porous blue clay. The only source found for this clay is over a hundred miles away, in the rugged Sierra Madre Mountains.

We prospered now and enjoyed more of the comforts of life than we could renember in previous years. The town was growing and the young people enjoyed themselves with their home-fashioned socials, dances and parties.

All through my childhood I had longed for the companionship and association of cousins and other close relatives, and often thought how wonderful it would be just to have some little thing an aunt, uncle or grandparent had given me so I could brag about it as some of my little friends had done.

I was seventeen before I ever saw one of my grandparents or any other close relative, except for a very short visit of an uncle while we were still in the mountains.
