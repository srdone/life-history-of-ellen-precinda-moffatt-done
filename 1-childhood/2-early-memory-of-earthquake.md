They planted their crops. Mother did so enjoy watching the plants grow.
The squash vines grew so fast they seemed to be pulling the helpless
little squash over the warm sand. The squash didn't seem to mind
as they grew about as fast as the vines did.

In November their crops were harvested: beans, peanuts, squash, musk
melons and pumpkins. In December they moved to the site purchased for
their colony.

My father constructed two nice little dugouts, side by side. Here Mother
and Aunt Maria spent their first winter in Mexico. For Christmas we
had molasses cakes and candy with black walnuts in them. Dried squash
and musk melon tasted mighty good as there were no other fruits or
vegetables to be had. We also enjoyed parched corn.

My first vivid childhood memory is of an earthquake, on May 27, 1886,
just a week after my birthday. I was in our back yard going toward the
house when I suddenly found it very hard to walk. I couldn't even
stand still so I sat down and looked around to see what was wrong.
I saw some men in the field nearby, leaning on their shovels and
swaying back and forth. They were yelling something at each other.
The ground seemed to be rising and falling and looked very much like
ripples on running water. I heard Aunt Maria scream and turned to
see why. She was coming out of the house with her baby in her
arms. She was so unsteady she bumped both sides of the door frame
as she came out. Just then I heard someone say, "Its an earthquake."
I soon got up and was glad to find I could walk as good as ever. The
land was again still and smooth and the men in the field went on
with their work.

Mother came from a neighbor's and told us that while she was visiting
she suddenly had a very unsteady feeling and noticed that her neighbor
was also experiencing this same unsteadiness, plus great fear. Soon
everything in sight was unsteady - even the dishes in the cupboard were
shaking and rattling. The neighbor woman became panicky and began
crying with fear. Then Mother started to laugh. The woman was horrified
and said, "Don't you know itâ€™s an earthquake? How can you laugh?" Mother
said, "Laughing is more fun than crying and neither will make a bit of
difference in the consequences of this or any other earthquake."

Later I learned the earthquake had spread over an area forty miles
wide and had gained strength as it passed on to the State of Sonora
where many buildings and some churches were demolished. But the old
saying, 'It's an ill wind that blows no good', applied here, as this
earthquake opened up additional springs along the river, increasing
its flow at least one-third which proved a great blessing to the farmers
in the whole area.
