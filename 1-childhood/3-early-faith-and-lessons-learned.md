There was not enough money to buy toys so all of ours were homemade.
One fine spring day some neighbor boys were making willow whistles
in our yard. How I wished they would make one for me, but I didn't ask.
I was too shy. After they left I found a piece of willow they had sliced
off and went around with it in my mouth, tooting and pretending it was
a whistle. I stumbled and the sharp willow went down my throat, cutting
deep into the roof of my mouth. The wound was very serious. There were
no doctors and no drug stores, so my mother used what she had at hand
and prayed humbly that I would be healed. Though I still carry an ugly
scar in the roof of my mouth, the wound healed with no bad results.

Honesty was early instilled into our hearts and minds by our loving
parents. I remember one day, about this time, of watching a neighbor
family preparing to move. As my sister and I started home we saw a
couple of small pieces of pretty, new calico near their woodpile. We
picked them up, supposing they had been thrown away, and took them home,
thrilled at the prospects of new doll clothes. Mother explained to us
that we must not take things from other people's yards, and that the
neighbor very likely intended using the cloth for quilt blocks. We
reluctantly put them back where we had found them, but were happily
surprised to see them still there the next day after the family had
left. Mother said we could have them. I wondered if our dolls were as
happy as we were.

Mother had had some dairying experience in her childhood, so when
Brother Isaac Turley wanted someone to care for his herd of cows
and make butter and cheese on shares, she decided to do it. She
took her family and the herd of cows into the mountains for the
summer. She camped by the new sawmill where Father was working to
get lumber for a new house. There was good feed for the cows, she was
with her husband, and she made extra money by cooking for the mill
workers. We children had a very happy and cool summer.
