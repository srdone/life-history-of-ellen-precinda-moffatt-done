Aunt Maria and her three children remained in Colonia Juarez. going to
the mountains at the time we moved to Cave Valley. While still in
Juarez, her son Willard Franklin was born on May 10, 1887.

How well I remember that summer! There were mountains to climb, big
trees to rest and play under, beautiful flowers to pick and a lovely
stream to watch and listen to. We gathered pine gum, wild grapes,
squawberries and acorns. We often saw squirrels. Sometimes they would
chatter at us. Parakeets flew overhead, scolding at each other and at
us. Songbirds filled the air with their lovely melodies.

Mother was a very humble, prayerful woman and often received warnings
which she heeded to her own and others benefit.

One morning we were at our favorite playground - the sawdust pile.
We were really enjoying ourselves in our playhouse in the soft sawdust
when we saw Mother running toward us. She grabbed the baby and told
the rest of us to come quickly. We saw no reason but hurried after her.
We hadn't gone far when we heard Father's voice from up the mountainside,
calling, "Look out below!" Just then two logs came tumbling down and
landed right where we had been playing. Mother sat down on a rock. When
she could get her breath she told us she had been very busy preparing
dinner when, all of a sudden, a feeling came over her that the children
were in danger. She started out to see about us. As she came to where
she could see us she thought she must have been mistaken and was about
to go back and let us go on with our play, as we seemed to be
enjoying it so much. When she turned to go back that awful feeling of
near danger came again, stronger than ever, and she knew she must
get her children to the house. She never hesitated even a split
second whenever she felt a warning of danger again.

It being summer, Father had not hurried to put doors and windows in our
small home, but when an electric storm came up one evening it really
brought a night of terror. Mother was alone with the children. The
lightening flashed brighter and the thunder roared louder than I have
ever heard since. It seemed like the whole mountain would be split
apart. The rain fell in torrents and the wind whirled it through the
house, leaving everything and everybody drenched. Between thunderclaps
we could hear lions roaring angrily. We children were terribly frightened,
but we had Mother to cling to. She trusted in her Heavenly Father to
protect us, which he did.

When the storm passed and morning finally came the sunshine seemed
brighter and more welcome than any other time I can remember.

Soon the sawmill was moved farther up into the mountains and Father
decided to move there also and try his luck at stock raising. This was a
disappointment to Mother and Aunt Maria, as they had expected to go
back down to the valley settlement of Colonia Juarez.

In our new settlement at Cave Valley we found the climate about the same,
but our social life was quite different as there were several families.
We had our regular Sunday School, Primary and Church, and an occasional
picnic when we would go to see the ancient caves near Cliff Ranch. The
great olla was one of the main sights of interest. Here, in a large cave,
ancient cliff dwellers had built a huge stone olla. It was apparent that
this olla had been used for food storage. The other children and I were
always thrilled to hear the stories the grownups would tell of how they
felt these ancient people, the Lamanites, lived in the caves, storing I
their food there and even diverting a nearby stream so it ran right
through one of the caves. They had also farmed on the nearby mountain
sides, as evidence still remained showing the ground had been terraced
off for the raising of crops.

While Father was plowing that first season in Cave Valley, his little
son Ben loved to be with him. One day he left the youngster resting under
a tree and started down another long stretch with the plow. Suddenly, he
felt deeply impressed to look after the child. He turned back to see him
lying on the ground kicking weakly and waving his arms. He ran and
picked him up. He could see a small round lump in his neck that showed
the child had something lodged in his throat. He placed his hands under
the object and pushed upwards, carefully but quickly, working at it until
he dislodged a small gourd.

How grateful he was that he had heeded the still small voice that prompted
him, and how he determined to try always to live so as to have the spirit
of the Lord with him as a guide and protection to himself and family.
Father built two small lumber houses under some nice pines and moved his
families in. There was a small brook nearby. This Father diverted, bringing
running water up to the houses. He was always thoughtful in having water
and wood handy and in abundance for his families.

Besides furnishing water for home use this brook was nice to play by,
splash and wade in. The most treasured memories about it were the
occasions when my older brother and sister were baptized in it. The most
terrifying is of one afternoon when my brother Junius called, "Look at
that bear." We all looked and. saw a big brown bear walking quietly
along the side of the mountain.

Our neighbors saw it about the same time we did. Mother brought the gun
to Father and he and Brother Kartchner went after the bear. The next
morning we all went down the creek to see it. The men had shot it on a
ledge and it had fallen over, landing in the stream with all four feet
sticking up in the air. They saved the skin for a robe and the fat to be
used in soap making.

Father took two sturdy poles, bored holes in the ends and fastened them
around a strong tree limb. Holes were also bored in the hanging ends
where he fastened a seat. This made a swing for us. We always called it
the 'log swing', Many pleasant hours were spent in it by all the children
in the settlement.

Mother's next child was born November l4, l887, soon after our move to
Cave Valley. This was a fine son. They named him Norman David. The night
was dark and too stormy to go for other help, so my father and Aunt
Maria helped him come into his new home where all of us welcomed and
loved him.

Our clothes were becoming worn, we had no money for new ones, and there
were no stores anyway. Father helped shear sheep at a neighbor's* taking
wool for his pay. He remembered his mother's spinning wheel and made one
patterned after it, on which yarn was spun to be knitted and crocheted
into many pieces of useful clothing.

I remember helping weave willow baskets, braid and make straw hats,
cord wool, make cheese and butter. I also remember watching Father make
the spinning wheel, cheese press, butter paddle, press and bowl, and
many other things to help make the work easier. He also made all of our
furniture.

After the first snowfall that winter Father made a nice sleigh and took
us, as well as our neighbors, for many pleasant rides.
