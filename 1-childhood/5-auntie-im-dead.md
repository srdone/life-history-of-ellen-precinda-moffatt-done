Wherever Mother lived she made a garden and we all enjoyed its abundance of
beets, radishes, turnips, carrots, squash, potatoes, and whatever else
could be grown and harvested before the frosts came.

One summer Ben and Della were hoeing weeds in our garden when they heard
the unmistakable buzz of a rattlesnake. Della wanted to run, but Ben said
bravely that he would kill it as it was dangerous to let it remain loose
around the garden. His hoe was sharp but he was not a very big boy, and
it took several whacks before he was able to cut off its head. Della had
used her hoe to help keep the snake from coiling up while he whacked.
They sat down on the ground to rest and talk over their adventure.
Their excitement had attracted the rest of the children and they all
gathered around Ben and the snake. Ben became bold and picked up the
snakehead by its stub of a neck. It was still blinking its eyes and
blathering its tongue. He dared Della to stick her finger into its mouth,
but she refused. He then said if she would prop its mouth open with a
stick he would put his finger in. She took a dry weed stalk and poked
it into the snake's mouth. Ben stuck his finger in and the snake's jaws
clamped shut. Frantically he shook his hand until the snakehead flew
off into the weeds and rocks never to be seen again. Realizing he had
been bitten and remembering stories of people dying from rattlesnake
bites, he ran toward the house screaming, "Auntie, I'm dead. Auntie,
I'm dead." We all ran after him screaming, "Auntie, I'm dead. Auntie,
I'm dead."

From her chair under a tree, where she was weaving baskets, Mother looked
out on the livliest bunch of 'dead' children she had ever seen.

The situation was serious. Father and Aunt Maria had gone to the
Williams Ranch, five miles away, where he was to do some carpenter
work. They expected to be gone for a week or ten days. Our nearest
neighbors, the Kartchners, were also away from home. Mother was alone
with her own and Aunt Maria's children.

She picked up a piece of string she had been using in her basket weaving
and made a tourniquet around Ben's wrist to keep the poison from going
up his arm. She gave him a swallow of liquor from her meager medical
supplies to keep the poison from going to his stomach. Next she split
his finger through the fang marks and sucked out all the poison she
could. His hand began to swell very badly.

She had none of the medications needed to treat snake bites, so she used
what she had. She carried in a pan of thick, wet mud from the creek
and put the bitten hand into it. The mud steamed up like a kettle of
boiling water. All through the night she kept her anxious vigil,
changing the mud as it became hot with the poison it drew from the
snakebite. By morning the swelling was almost gone and Ben was his
own mischievous self within a few days.

Mother took the children up the creek to gather willows for basket
weaving, one afternoon. We heard a strange noise above us, as if a
large animal was coming toward us. Quickly Mother got us out onto
the wagon road and we started home. We could hear crackling brush
along the roadside and knew whatever it was was following us. We were
thankful when we reached home safely.

That evening, just after dark, Della went out to get a basket of chips.
She saw something come creeping toward her. She dropped the basket
and ran to the house in fright. Taking his gun, Father went outside,
with all of us following him. A large lion leaped into the brush
and Father fired several shots after it. This was a lesson to us
not to go far from home without proper protection and not to go out
alone after dark.
