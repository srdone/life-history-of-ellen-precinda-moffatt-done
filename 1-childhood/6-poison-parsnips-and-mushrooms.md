One day Della and I were playing house by the creek. We had gathered wild
flowers and other things to decorate with, when we noticed how pretty the
wild parsnip stalks looked. We knew we should not pick them, as Father
and Mother had warned us to leave them alone because they were very
poisonous and would likely kill anyone who might eat them. We argued
that we were not going to eat them, just use them in our bouquets. We
did this without considering our little brother Junius and what he might
do. Suddenly Della noticed that he was eating one of the stalks. She
grabbed him and ran to the house screaming to Mother what had happened.

Father clinched his hands and said, "poison parsnips." with such anguish
and despair in his voice, we knew the situation was much more serious
than we had thought. Mother said nothing, but took her little son in
her arms and looked up toward heaven. We could feel, and almost hear
the prayer in her heart. Ever since, when I hear that phrase, "the
upward glancing of an eye", from the song, Prayer is the Soul's Sincere
Desire, I can see my mother's face as she held her small child and
silently pleaded with God in His Heaven to help her.

Quickly she went to work and, with Father's help they poured tepid
salt water down the baby's throat, forcing him to take it though he
was almost too sick to swallow. Hours dragged on like centuries as
we watched our anxious parents fight desperately to save the life
of their little son. Through their work, faith, and God's help,
the little boy lived and regained his health.

I had heard grownups talk about how delicious mushrooms were and that
they were something like toadstools in shape and color. One day I
found some pretty, white toadstools with delicate pink colorings
underneath. I thought, surely here were mushrooms that ought to be
very delicious. Anything so pretty just had to be good to eat. I
sampled one and was dissappointed. I put salt on it, but that didn't
help. Next I broke one up in water and tried it, tut that didn't help
either. Then I decided to get some sugar, surely that would make them
good. As I started to the house everything about me seemed to whirl
and I fell to the ground unconscious.

The next thing I remember, Father had me on his lap and I was getting
the tepid salt water treatment. My stomach was soon cleaned out and
it wasn't long until I felt fine again. But, to this day, I don't
care whether mushrooms are yellow, brown, pink or black, I just don't
seem to want any.
