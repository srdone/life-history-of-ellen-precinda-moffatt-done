The only fresh fruits that grew in these mountains were wild grapes and
prickly pears. One fall my parents decided to go over to a little town
called El Valle, where there was an abundance of peaches. They stayed
about three weeks, drying the fruit as they had no other way to preserve
it. How we did enjoy those dried peaches that winter!

Aunt Maria's son Ether John was born March 4, 1889. One year later my
mother's daughter Mary Lovenia was born, February 25, 1890.

My most treasured possessions, as a child, were made and given to me by
my parents. Mother made me a little willow basket in which I kept my
sewing and other handwork. I learned to crochet before I was old enough
to go to school, and longed for a hook I could call my very own. One
evening Father took a piece of kindling wood from the woodbox by the
stove. It was a nice, straight piece of cedar wood. He whittled me a
lovely crochet hook. No child could ever have been prouder than I was.

Father traded for a little pony, not large enough for a work horse,
but a joy to all the children as he was gentle and most always
accomodating. He was always searching around among the rocks, etc.,
for a bit of grass overlooked by the other animals, so we called him
Grubber. Often we would pile onto his back until he was covered with
children from his ears to his tail. Patiently he would trudge along
under this load until he could take it no longer. He would then sit
down on his haunches and we would all slide to the ground in a heap.
No amount of coaxing, cajolling or scolding could induce him to move
again until he was good and ready.

Although it was a walk of more than a mile and a half to Primary, Mother
always saw to it that we got there, and she was one of tne teachers most
of the time. We usually went to Church with Father in the wagon.

Father was always on hand to help with any community project. He helped
build the roads, the Meeting House, which also served as a school house,
the canals and irrigation ditches. One stretch of road was called Moffett's
Dugway, another, Campbell's Hump, because these men did most of the
labor on them. The creek that ran through our land was called Moffett's
Creek.

My little brother Norman was my shadow. We dearly loved each other.
One of the things he and I liked to do the most was to climb up the
hill by our house and roll rocks down it. It was fun to watch them
bump along or flying through the air for a ways before they landed.
