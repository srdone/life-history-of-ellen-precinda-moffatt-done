In the spring of 1890 Father decided to move his families to Pacheco,
about five miles farther up into the mountains, as there was a larger
community there and his children needed better schooling. He took
Mother and the larger children on ahead to help get the new homes
ready, leaving Aunt Maria and the smaller children with the Kartchner
family. Several of the children, both in Cave Valley and Pacheco,
were taken with diptheria. Aunt Maria's baby Ether died January 13,
1891, very suddenly, almost before his mother realized he was sick.
She also had her daughter Laura very ill with it, while Mother, in
Pacheco, had me in a very critical condition.

As night came on I grew worse, my breath coming in short, raspy
whistles. Father and Mother prayed for wisdom to know what to do for
me. While they were praying Mother saw a piece of soap pass before her
face. Instantly she remembered this choice piece of soap in the bottom
of her trunk. She got it quickly and was prompted to scrape some fine
and roll it into three small pills which she gave to me at halfâ€”hour
intervals. She also put ice packs on my throat and chest and kept my
feet in warm water. Soon I was breathing normally and was fast asleep.
By morning I was much better.

That morning word came that baby Ether was dead, and that Laura was dying.
Quickly Mother placed a few things in a bag and climbed into the wagon.
She urged the driver to use all possible speed. They covered the five
miles of rough mountain road in record time, but none too soon, as Laura
was very near death. Mother used the same remedies for her as she had used
for me. Neighbors stood by shaking their heads, positive the child would
die under such treatment, but Mother quietly continued to administer the
soap pills, change the ice packs on her throat and chest; and keep her
feet in warm water. Soon consciousness returned to the small patient and
her breathing became normal.

Once again wisdom had been given in answer to their humble prayers. God
was good, and they determined to serve Him even more diligently.
