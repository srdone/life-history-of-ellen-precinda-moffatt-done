Soon we were all settled in Pacheco. Father had bought quite a little herd of stock which he hoped would thrive better in Pacheco, as Cave Valley had proved to be too rough and rocky.

Aunt Maria's son Loren William was born May 1, 1891.

That spring Mother again planted a nice garden. She also planted some lovely flowers, the only flower garden in town. Father soon dug the first well. It was the only one for quite a while and most of our neighbors came there for their drinking water.

Before the new meeting and schoolhouse was finished we had Primary in the different homes. We Primary children made some articles to be taken to the Fair to be held in Colonia Juarez. We were always being taught to do twines with our hands.

Jesse N. Smith, our Bishop, taught school for some time, until other teachers could be procured. A Sister Ella Heaton taught for a while, though she had a small baby she had to bring with her. She continued that fall until the weather was too cold to make it safe for her to have her baby in the drafty, partially heated schoolhouse. When she quit Pleasant Williams and his wife Annie took over the teaching.

A group of the older boys were rather unruly. Brother Williams did his best to bring them under control as he was anxious to have a model school. One afternoon they left school at the recess period and did not return. The teacher was very upset and thought they should all have a good thrashings. Their parents and the school trustees persuaded him that it wouldn't be wise to attempt thrashing such big boys, so he consented to having them make an apology before the school.

The next morning they lined up across the stage. Their ringleader asked if they should apologize separately or in concert. Their teacher didn't catch what was said and quickly told them to do it together. They made a very formal bow and began. About half way through they couldn't hold back their laughter any longer, and left in a riot never to return to that school again. A few of the other older children, not involved in that episode, also left.

Sister Maria Ray was the first Sunday School teacher I remember. She was a wonderful teacher and we all loved her very much.

Father helped with the school building, the making of new roads, building bridges, and other community projects.
