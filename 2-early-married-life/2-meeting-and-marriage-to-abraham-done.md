Late one afternoon of that winter I was watering my window plants when I saw Brother Abraham Done pass by. He had his baby son in his arms and was trying to shield him from the cold wind. The tender way he carried his little son awakened in my heart a deep respect for him. During the next year several things happened to increase this respect for him.

On the third of March 1903, his wife gave him a party to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. My mother and I were among the guests invited. It was a lovely party and I found myself thinking more of Brother Done and his whole family than ever before.

At this time he had two families. His first wife, Elizabeth Annie Robinson Done (lovingly known to all as Aunt Lizzie) had eight living children and had lost three in their infancy. His second wife, Louisa Mathilda Haag Abegg Done, was a widow with four children when he had married her. It was for this reason the Done family had left their comfortable home and surroundings in Payson, Utah and moved to Old Mexico. He and his first wife had heard the Church Authorities state that the worthy men of the Church should enter into the practice of plural marriage, and had decided that they wanted the blessings promised those who did.

About this time he was approached by local Church Authorities and asked if he felt he could take this certain widow to wife and provide for her and her destitute little family. As such marriages were by this time prohibited by law in the boundaries of the United States, they decided to go to Mexico where there was no law against the practice, and where there would be no persecutions to mar their lives. He married Louisa Abegg on November 18, 1900, in Colonia Juarez, Mexico.

Soon after this birthday celebration Brother Done asked me to marry him and I found it easy to say I would. I knew he was a wonderful man and that my respect for him was ripening into real love.

Very soon after I had promised to marry him, and after we had made our plans to go to Juarez to be married, I dreamed that we were going somewhere together when we came to a big ditch of muddy water. As we stood there, wondering how to cross the stream, I had a feeling that we would not be able to do so and get to our destination at that particular time, but that we would definitely be able to do so later on.

Shortly after this we went to Juarez to be married. When we stopped in front of the home of Anthony W. Ivins, then president of our Juarez Stake, Brother Done went in alone, leaving me in the buggy. The feeling came to me that this was the big ditch of water and that we wouldn't be getting married that evening, but a deep assurance came that we would be married at a later date.

When Brother Done came back out he told me that President Ivins felt it would be best for us to wait until after the General Conference of the Church in April, but for me to go to Salt Lake City with those attending Conference and get my endowments in the Temple there. He said he wanted to be sure it was in accordance with the desires of the General Church authorities before he performed any more plural marriages. Several such marriages had been performed within the month or two previous to this time, but we were very willing to await President Ivins' return from Conference, as we wished to do nothing without the sanction of those in authority.

In company with a group of several young women who had recently entered into plural marriage, my sister Laura being one of them, I left by train for Salt Lake City, where we would attend the General Conference and go through the Temple for our endowments. This was my first train ride and also the first time I had been away from home for more than a day or so. The trip was wonderful, marred only by one small wreck which my sister Laura, to the day she died, claimed was all her fault.

In her rush to prepare for this journey she was doing some sewing on a Sunday afternoon when an old friend came in. He chided her for breaking the Sabbath and told her that her work would come to naught, and she had better quit or they would have a wreck on the way. She thought he was joking and felt she must finish her sewing, Sunday or not.

On our way we encountered a snowslide which caused the engine of the train to drive into the mountainside. The impact shook us up considerably, though we were all very thankful the engine hadn't gone off the other side, as all the cars would surely have rolled over and over down the steep incline.

When everything was again under control Laura was vehemently sobbing that it was all her fault. Also, when she came to wear the skirt she had fixed on that Sunday afternoon, she learned that her work of the Sabbath had really 'come to naught'. She had replaced a torn gore in a black cash-mere skirt without realizing there was more than one shade of black. The new gore was bluish black while the rest of the skirt was of a brown hue.

Some hours later we were on our way again and arrived at our destination in safety.

I really did enjoy that April Conference. I met many of my relatives I had never seen before, and old friends who had moved away from Mexico years before. I reveled in seeing and climbing high mountains, going through forests of pine, oak, cedar and quaking aspen. Always on such occasions I tried to see things as they were in Book of Mormon days. We also went out to the Great Salt Lake, along the Jordan River, and to Utah Lake. I saw where coal, copper, silver and gold were being, or had been mined, from the bowels of the earth.

I visited places where my parents had lived, the grave of my little brother and those of other relatives. As I stood there I again thanked my Heavenly Father that I knew that one of the duties of the Holy Ghost was to take care of the integral parts of the human body which will help to make the resurrection possible and the reunion of families in the world to come.

I also enjoyed going about the Temple grounds, knowing that my father had worked there as a stone cutter while my mother studied obstetrics preparing herself for her long life of service to mankind.

Most of all, I enjoyed going through the Temple, which I did several times. It was especially wonderful to have the privilege of performing these sacred ordinances for my sister Della, who had died at the age of thirteen. After these, and many other pleasant experiences, we had a very nice trip home.

A short time after our return home Brother Done told me that President Ivins had said he would be happy to marry us. On June 5, 1903 we were married for time and eternity, in his home in Juarez. We have always been very thankful to know that he had the proper authority to perform this plural marriage, from the Prophet, Seer and Revelator of our Church.

An explanation is given here so readers will understand why my mother always referred to her husband as 'Brother Done', or 'my husband', never calling him by his first name.

At a Stake Conference held in Juarez in April of 1903, the visiting authority from Salt Lake City had his wife meet with all the women who had entered into plural marriage, or soon would do so. Aunt Lizzie, Aunt Louisa and my mother were in attendance.

The visiting Sister gave them sound advice and then conducted a question and answer period. Finally she asked some of the first wives to tell what special things upset them most in accepting the later wives of their husbands. Aunt Lizzie said that one of the hardest things for her to accept was to have the other wife call her husband by his first name.

My mother respected her in this all her life and never called her husband by his first name.

In addressing her children she referred to him as 'papa' or 'your father', but none of us ever heard her call him Abe or Abraham as Aunt Lizzie did.        ——Olive Done Hall.
