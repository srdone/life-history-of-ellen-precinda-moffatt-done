For the first six years of my married life I lived in the home of my husband's first wife, having two rooms of my own. I found her to be a very good, kind, motherly woman.

Aunt Louisa had a small home just west, across the railroad tracks. Her son William Jared was born September 12, 1903.

My first child, Reed, was born in Aunt Lizzie's home on March 15, 1904. He was his father's fourteenth child and tenth son. He was born on the twenty-eighth birthday of Lizzie's first child, Arthur Jesse.

Next came my daughter Olive, born May 13, 1906, in the home of my parents, where I had gone to stay a week or so while Lizzie was away on a visit.

Just three months later Louisa's daughter, Marba, was born on August 9, 1906. Next followed the birth of my son Leo, December 21, 1907.
One afternoon Reed and his little cousin, Mary Harris, were playing between two long stacks of hay. Their Uncle John Robinson was trying to catch a young, untamed horse in the next field. In desperation, the animal broke through the fence and headed toward the haystacks, starting between them on a gallop. Uncle John watched, horrified, when, suddenly the horse stopped, just as he reached the children, walked carefully around them then continued his wild dash for freedom. This was a miracle! The animal certainly had used good 'horse sense', which he displayed on many other occasions for he became one of our most trusted work horses.

At one of our family parties the children met Aunt Louisa's brother, Richard Haag. He was almost completely bald. This fascinated Reed, as most of the men he had seen had pretty good heads of hair.

A short time after this we decided it was time to cut his baby curls. His father made the preparations, but, much to his surprise, he found he had a very unwilling child. He reasoned, coaxed and even offered bribes, but to no avail. Little Reed finally blurted out, "I don't want my hair cut! Do you think I want to look like Uncle Haag?"

Aunt Lizzie's son Heber and his young friends were playing with their flippers, which interested little Reed very much. He watched them practicing their shooting and decided he would have to have one too. He gathered three little sticks, a hammer and some nails and tried to fashion a flipper stalk. While he was trying to make it work Heber came along. How he did laugh when he saw that contraption! As soon as he could get his breath he took Reed by the hand, went out to a large mesquite bush where he cut a good stalk with which he made a neat little flipper. It was one of Reed's most prized possessions as a little child.

In the summer of 1908 my husband bought a ten-acre farm on the west of town. There was a small one-room house on it to which he later added another room. This was my home from that time until the Exodus in 1912.

That fall Louisa's son Otto was born, November 21, 1908. Just one year later my son Bernard joined the family, born November 18, 1909.
I was so very happy to have my own home. We planted wheat, alfalfa, fruit and shade trees, grapevines, vegetables and flowers. We had our own cows and chickens, as did most of the families in town.

The children were all anxious to do their part to make our new home a success. Reed, though very young, decided he would learn to milk the cow. She was a rather cantankerous animal, red with white markings and an all-white face. We called her Broco, which was Spanish for 'bald face'. Swinging his little bucket in one hand and waving a stick in the other, he approached her, from the wrong side, calling, "So-soo-sooo, Broco, Soo-sooo-sooo, hyste!" As he came nearer she lowered her head and shook it at him threateningly, but he continued bravely on, calling, "So-soo-sooo, Broco, hyste!" And hyste she did, but not as he had expected, for she hysted him right over the corral fence where he landed on his little sit-down with a thud.

He was not easily discouraged, but decided to get help from his mother before he tried it again. After a few lessons from her on the proper approach, etc., he was milking Broco like a veteran. This was before he started school.

Our new home was not far from the homes of our close relatives, so the children enjoyed going to Grandpa Moffett's, Aunt Lizzie's, and playing with the children of their older brothers and sisters. Like most children, they really enjoyed family get-togethers and dinners, birthday parties and outings. These occasions were usually enlivened with the music from their father's beloved violin.

We enjoyed many blessings and privileges here in Dublan. One was Stake Conference. At one of these occasions Uncle John Robinson introduced Brother Done to the visiting authority from Salt Lake City, saying that he was the man who never stayed on the straight and narrow long at a time. "In fact", he said, "he gets of the track oftener than any other man in town." Just then someone chipped in with, "And if he didn't, he would find a lot of us after him to get him to do so." "Well", said the visitor, "I know Brother Done to "be a very good man, so what's the catch?" "One home east and two homes west, and the railroad tracks in between."

People often commented on the many trips he took from England to Germany, to Ireland, then back to England, then round and round again. This was because his first wife was English, his second wife was German and I had considerable Irish blood in my veins.

In the summer of 1910 our garden boasted a few watermelon vines. The children, especially Reed and Olive, watched over them constantly. As one of the melons developed much faster than the others, I let the two children claim it as their own.

That fall, about the time Reed was to start school, a peddler came by with his interesting collection. The children tried his whistles, looked over the dolls, pocket knives and other baubles that they would liked to have owned, but I was away and they had nothing with which to buy them. The peddler eyed the big watermelon and said he would take that in payment. At first the children couldn't even think of parting with it. They had spent all summer caring for it and watching it grow, and dreaming of the wonderful day when they could pick and eat it. But the treasures in the peddler's pack were too much for them. Finally they drew up a deal very satisfactory to themselves, a real pocket knife for Reed and a china-faced doll for Olive. The melon went into one of the tig bags hanging from the back of the peddler's donkey, and the children sat down on the doorstep to await my return, sure that I would feel as they did â€“ that they had driven a good bargain.

One evening, soon after this, we went out to attend to the chores. Reed sat down on a big rock in the yard, saying he was just too tired to milk Broco that night. By morning he was really sick with what proved to be a bad case of scarlet fever. We felt certain he had picked up the germs from the peddler's pack, as there were several cases of the disease in Stringtown where he lived.

My mother helped care for Reed and said he was one of the sickest children she had known to get over scarlet fever with no after-effects. This was another time when my mother was indeed an angel of mercy to us.

When Reed was well enough to go to school, he said, "I'm glad now that you didn't get my new overalls for the first day of school, because now I can wear them longer before they have to be washed." We hadn't been able to get his size until after his bout with scarlet fever, and everything in the house had to be washed or fumigated before we were out of quarantine.

On February 17, 1911 Aunt Louisa's last child was born. This was a lovely baby girl. They named her Beth.
