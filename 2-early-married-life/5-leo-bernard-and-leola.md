My little Leo was a beautiful blond youngster, with big blue eyes
and a very sweet smile. He loved his pockets and always found use
for them. Whether we were picking peas or beans, or gathering eggs,
something would always have to go into those nice pockets to be carried
to the house. Like all children, he tried to do what the rest of us
were doing, especially when we were sewing. He had to have his bit of
cloth and a needle and thread. He was small for his age. He and his
brother Bernard, two years younger, were about the same size this
spring of 1911.

Early in June, as I was washing dishes, I seemed to see a little casket
float before my eyes, followed by the sight of two little graves, and
to hear a voice say, "One little casket, two little graves." This
premonition persisted though I tried to brush it from my mind.

A day or so later Leo came down with diptheria and died almost before
we knew what was wrong with him. Olive and Reed both took it and were
very sick the night Leo died. I knew this was the answer to the little
casket I had seen, and I feared another of my precious children would
soon go, making the two little graves. Even when they both recovered
the premonition stayed with me and persisted in my mind until September
when my husband took me out to the cemetery to see Leo's grave for the
first time. There I saw the two little graves, my little Leo's and that
of Lizzie's little Ahram who had died of the same disease in January of
1902.

Early that spring I had let the children put turkey eggs under an old
setting hen. She had had quite a struggle to raise her little brood;
surely they neither looked or behaved like she thought her children
should. Finally there was only one little turkey left. She guarded him
carefully, bringing him through to the time when he could fend for himself.
He was a fine young turkey and we all looked forward to Thanksgiving
when he would become the main course of our dinner. But tragedy was to
cut his life short.

Bernard had a very sore toe. I had bandaged it up with quite a poultice
to draw out the inflamation. As he was playing in the yard, Mr. Turkey
spied the bandaged toe, and, thinking it might be something good to eat,
gave it a peck. Bernard screamed out with pain and let poor Mr. Turkey
have it across the head with a big stick he had been using for a horse.
Well, the story ended with Bernard saying, "He tried to eat me, but now
I am eating him." It was still quite some time to Thanksgiving when
something else would have to substitute for the turkey as the main course.

On January 12, 1912, another little girl came to bless our home. We named
her Leola. She was a delicate baby, and, because of the unrest in the
Country just prior to the Mexican Revolution, I was over-worried and did
not have enough milk for her. Substitute foods that were available did
not seem to agree with her, and we had quite a struggle to bring her through.
