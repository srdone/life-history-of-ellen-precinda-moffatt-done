All through that spring and early summer we were uncertain as to our
standing in Mexico. Pancho Villa, the rebel leader, had vowed to kill
every American in Mexico. Though we could sympathize with him on his
stand against those Americans who had ruthlessly exploited the Country
to their gain, we knew we were not guilty of such actions, for, as a
people, we had sought always to help our neighbors to a better way of life.

By July of this year we received word from our Church Authorities that
we were to leave Mexico, and that arrangements were made for us to enter
the United States for protection.

It was a great trial to my husband, as well as to the rest of the
colonists, to have to leave their homes and lands which they had
struggled so hard to obtain and improve.

Here my husband had managed to get his three families comfortably
situated, had purchased several pieces of farm land that he and his
boys were working successfully, and had a good job, plus an interest
in a thriving carpenter shop. He had commenced to build me a nice
four-room home which was just about ready for floors, doors, windows,
etc. All the materials to complete my home had been purchased, but we
had to leave it when we were driven out.

This brings to my mind another premonition I had about this time. One
day I was dosing in the yard, after sitting there thinking how nice
my new home would be. I dreamed an old man came up, looked at the house,
then turned to me and said, "But it will go to staves." This is just
about what it did before I was ever to enjoy it as a home.

When final arrangements were being made for the evacuation of our little
town, we tried to put our most precious belongings that we could not
take with us away safely so they would be there if we ever had the
opportunity of returning to our homes.

Bottled fruit, churns, separators, books, pictures, clothing, bedding,
and small pieces of furniture were stored under the floors. Large farm
impliments, as well as many other things, were buried in hay and straw
stacks. My father put many of my household furnishings and my children's
treasures with things of Mother's and Aunt Maria's between two large
straw stacks near his barn.

We were to leave by train and it would be very crowded. Each family
was allowed only one trunk and what they could carry with them. This
was in July of 1912. My baby Leola was still very frail and we feared
the upset conditions of this move would make her really ill.

The colonists from Chuichupi, Garcia, Pacheco, Juarez and Dublan, as
well as all Americans, Mormon and non-Mormon from all around, were to
be on this train. Those from Juarez and Dublan were the last to board.

It was a rainy, dark night which made the waiting very miserable. I
held my three little ones and baby close to me and tried to protect
the baby from getting wet. She was so sick and miserable. The sound of
her wailing stayed with me for years. I knew I was not alone in this
suffering for many of the other women also had sick children.

When the train arrived every car was really crowded. We got on the
best we could and were actually packed in like cattle, with only room
to stand. My husband wasn't able to help me, as all the men were needed
to load the trunks and other baggage, such as it was, and to make
sure everyone got on the train.

As the train pulled out I gathered my little children as close to me
as possible and offered a silent prayer for God's protection and the
strength to stand these trying times.

When the train stopped at Guzman, a little Mexican town, there were
cars on the side tracks where Mexicans were selling tortillas, tamales,
and other foods. My children were hungry and coaxed me to buy something,
but I did not dare as I knew how dirty the Mexicans were in their food
preparations. All the other mothers felt the same, so the poor Mexicans
were really disappointed.

The long night finally came to an end. We arrived at Ciudad Juarez
early in the morning.

Here we were met by Church members from El Paso, Texas, just across
the border. Arwell L. Pierce was in charge of helping us get settled.
He was the husband of my husband's older daughter, May. He had made
arrangements for the use of a large lumber shed where we were taken
to stay until better living quarters could be found for us in El Paso.
This was an open shed where each family was given a small space in
which to set up housekeeping. The men helped hang quilts and blankets
to give a little privacy.

Toilet facilities were very poor and far from adequate. Water was
scarce. There was only one faucet where people lined up all day long
with their pails, cans and kettles, waiting their turn.

On the day of our arrival several of those who were ill became worse
and it was soon apparent that they had typhoid fever. Our stay there
wasn't long. In a couple of days my husband found a duplex. He moved
me and my children into one side and his second wife, Louisa and her
children into the other. His first wife. Lizzie, with her two young
boys, had gone to live with her daughter May in El Paso.

The living arrangements in the duplex were not at all satisfactory.
In fact, they were unbearable. I soon found myself and family in a
house on the top of a hill in the Highland Drive area in El Paso.
Here I was able to relax and enjoy my little family again. The neighbors
were friendly and their children loved to join us on our little treks
over the hills, especially to 'Turtle Rock', where we picnicked, enjoyed
the wild flowers and tiny animals that scurried about us.
