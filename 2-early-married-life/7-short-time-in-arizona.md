My baby Leola was still very frail and it was hard to find any food that
would agree with her, so the poor little child was always hungry. One
evening at supper she grabbed a piece of raw onion and swallowed it before
I could get it away from her. I was very frightened as she went into one
convulsion after another. I knew the onion had lodged in her intestines.
I sent Reed to a neighbor who had a phone. She telephoned a doctor. This
doctor came in his little 'flivver' to the bottom of the hill. Here, the
'flivver' refused to go up the hill so he turned around and went back. We
all felt badly that he didn't feel the call serious enough to put forth
the effort to climb that little hill on foot.

With the help of this neighbor, we continued to do our best to save the
baby's life. The older children were crying. It seemed that only God could
save her. We all kneeled down around her bed and I offered up a prayer
from the bottom of my heart, knowing that my children and this non-Mormon
neighbor were praying also, with all their hearts.

After my prayer my baby's convulsions stopped and she fell into an
exhausted sleep. By the next morning the piece of onion had passed through
her and she was feeling much better. How we did thank our Heavenly Father
for his kindness and mercy to us in saving that little life.

A few days after this my oldest child, Reed, came down with typhoid
fever. He was very ill and several times we almost lost him. When he was
recovering I decided to give him a tub bath. The children brought in the
old washtub. Reed was excited and so anxious to get into that warm water,
for he had had his fill of sponge baths.

I had a pretty pink bar of soap, but when I started to bathe him with it
he began to cry. He thought it was a cupcake for him to eat. To make
things worse, next I lathered his hair, when, to my dismay, as I rinsed
it, every hair from his head came loose and fell into my hands. Reed
looked at his hair and cried, "Mama, you've washed out all my hair!" He
had such a sad little face. I tried to console him by saying, "Don't
worry, it will grow back in and maybe it will be curly." He cried out,
"I don't want curly hair, I'm not a girl." His head was absolutely bald,
but it soon grew back in, and, to his delight, it wasn't curly.

As Reed's health improved my daughter Olive came down with the same
illness. She was so very ill that she was delirious much of the time.

During this time my husband was away from home, working at anything he
could find to do to support both his small families. At the same time he
was trying to find a place to settle where he could support us and also
be with us.

Before Olive was over the typhoid we moved by train to Jamestation, a
little settlement about five miles west of Tucson. Arizona. There my
husband purchased several acres of land for farming. Here we lived in a
tent from late September to the spring of 1913.

Even though Leola was frail and sickly she was walking well at nine months
and talking a 'blue streak' by the time she was a year old. With her
first steps she began running away, keeping me and the three older
children busy finding her. She even ran away to a Gypsy camp near us,
giving Reed and Olive the scare of their lives. They were sure, from
the stories they had heard, that the Gypsies would steal her and they
would never see her again. Though they feared for themselves, they
heroically rescued Leola. She really protested the rescue, as she was
having the time of her life showing off for all those Gypsies.

During this winter in Jamestation my four children had red measles and
chicken pox and la grippe as well as the ordinary colds. Our tent was
cold and drafty, so I was hard-put to care properly for them.

At this time I was having a lot of bad headaches. I finally went to a
doctor. He told me my hair was much too thick and heavy, and that the
weight of it was causing my headaches. I had a large lock of my hair cut
out. The bob I wore on top of my head covered the empty spot. I sold
this hair for twenty-five dollars, using part of the money for Christmas
for my children.

Before spring came my husband and the other men who had settled in
Jamestation realized they had been cheated in the purchase of this
land, and that there was no water for irrigation, though it had been
promised in the purchase contract. Fortunately they were able to get
their money back and my husband bought some land a few miles northeast,
in the little settlement of Binghampton.

When my husband put the tent up in Binghampton he boarded up the sides
making it much firmer and more draft-proof. We lived in it while he was
building me a nice two-room house.

There was a frame house on this property into which my husband moved
his second wife, Louisa, and her family.

My husband had not dug a well on the property in Jamestation because
he never thought that we would be there long, but, almost as soon as he
got the tent up, he dug a well real close to it and put in a pump. The
neighbor men couldn't see why he went to all this bother when there was
a good water pump at Ed Payne's home, not two blocks away. He was
always considerate of me in seeing that water was as close at hand
as possible.

Practically all my life I had helped care for bees and really enjoyed
this means of supplying honey for my own family and selling any excess
to help buy other things we needed. 

I had acquired hives of bees while in Jamestation. After we were settled
in Binghampton my husband moved these bees there. He hired an elderly man
to help him. Everything went smoothly until they were unloading the
hives from the wagon. The elderly man slipped while he was unloading a
hive and it fell to the ground. It burst open and the angry bees swarmed
all over him, stinging him wherever they could. They got into his hat and
were stinging his head. In desperation he threw the hat as far as he could.

My little Bernard happened to be in the way of that flying hatful of
angry bees. It landed right on his little head. Poor child, for days he
didn't even look like a human being, he was so red and badly swollen.
He was really sick for over a week. He never wanted anything to do with
bees after that. Neither did the old gentleman. He had left the scene on
the run and did not return to help any more. In fact, my husband had to
take him his pay as he refused to ever come near those bees again.

Before winter set in I had my little family all settled in our new home.
What a comfort! How I thanked my Heavenly Father for all his wonderful
blessings to us. We had two rooms and the old tenthouse besides.

During this winter of 1913 - 1914 we also had the blessing of good health
to be thankful for. My two older children were able to attend school
regularly.

On March first a new baby came to join us. In the early morning hours
of that day I awakened my husband and told him to hurry and get the
midwife, a nearby neighbor, as the baby was already on its way into
the world. He dressed quickly but couldn't find his hat. For several
minutes he hunted to no avail. Finally I told him to go, hat or no
hat, as the baby was coming fast. It was a grave decision, as he never
left the house, even to step into the yard, without his hat. But he
decided in favor of the baby's safety and brought the midwife just in
time to deliver a fine baby boy. We named him Ammon, for his Grandfather
Moffett, that being his middle name.

Life went on and I enjoyed my new home, my children and new baby very much.
In the warm summer days I would often pack a lunch and take my children
for a walk through the forest of misquite trees that surrounded the homes
of our little town. They had fun finding rare desert flowers, watching
small desert animals scurry about, and gathering pretty rocks to go in our
flower garden.

The children and I planted and tended a small garden which helped us with
our food supply. I cared for my bees, saving what honey I thought my
family would use, and selling the rest to buy many needed things.

One year we had an exceptionally good honey season. We had had a lot of
rain, much more than usual through the winter and early spring. The
result was almost a solid carpet of yellow flowers. The bees were all
over them, much to the dismay of the barefoot children, but to the
delight of everyone who had bees, as the honey from these flowers was
about the clearest and best tasting there was to be had.

Before the summer was over I had all my honey cans full and had filled
all the other containers I could find.

One day a neighbor came by to buy honey for his two families. He bragged
on the good honey and talked of the abundant crop for quite a while,
then asked me how much I would charge for two five-gallon cans. I quoted
the going price. "Why, Sister Done, you could surely make me a better
offer than that, everyone owning bees has too much honey on hand. You
are going to have to sell it cheaper if you sell it at all. Now just how
much are you going to charge me?" I quoted him the same price. He was
quite upset, so I told him to buy from some other beekeeper if he could
get it any cheaper. "But, Sister Done," he continued, "your honey will
spoil. You're going to lose it if you don't come down in your price.
Now how much will you charge me?" I quoted the same price again. He
looked like he was about to have a spell of apoplexy, but he finally
dished out the money for the two cans.

During the next winter my daughter Olive fell under a loaded wagon. The
back wheel went across her body from her right shoulder to her left hip.
The driver, Old Brother Miller, carried her home. She was unconscious
for several days. My husband and some other Priesthood holders administered
to her, promising that she would recover. After she regained consciousness
it wasn't many days before she was up and around. Again we had occasion
to thank our Heavenly Father for his kindness and mercy.

The women of the town often got together in the different homes to quilt,
as our bedding was nearly always made this way, and quilting together
was much more pleasant than doing it alone. Our children would go with
us and we would each bring a favorite dish to help with the lunch.

One Sunday at Church, as I was seating my children on one of the long
tenches in our Chapel, my quiet, shy little Bernard was the last in line.
As he took his seat by his older brother, a huge, fat man puffed his way
toward him. Bernard kept looking up at him and crowding closer to his
brother. Finally, when this Brother Johnson settled himself on the bench,
just inches from my little boy, Bernard looked at me with great relief
in his eyes and whispered, "Whew, he's big, Mama."

The summer of 1916 brought another near tragedy to my little family. Reed,
Olive and Leola crawled onto the timbers underneath a hayrack while it
was moving. Leola crawled farther up front and was thrown under the back
wheel when the driver made a turn. The wheel went over her head, which had
luckily fallen into a rut in the road. Reed carried her home unconscious.
The driver, whoever he was, never knew what had happened. A stick had been
forced deep into one of her cheeks and through the side of her gum. Her
little head was bruised all over. It would have been crushed had it not
been for that rut. She was a very sick child for many weeks. I poulticed
the injured cheek, which festered angrily around where the stick had gone
in. Finally the festering broke and drained, bringing out all the remaining
splinters. The wound healed, leaving a scar that, in time, looked like a
dimple. Again our Heavenly Father had come to our rescue and saved the
life of another of our children.

In the early winter of this year my mother came to visit us. This was a
real joy to all of us, especially as another baby came to our home on
December 12, 1916. We named the baby Pearl.

I had trouble with gathered breasts and could not nurse her. None of the
baby food available agreed with her. We tried them all. Eagle Brand
Condensed Milk agreed with her better than anything else. She was frail
and sickly and was always spitting up her food in sour fountains.

My mother stayed until after Christmas, making this holiday time much more
joyous with her sweet spirit and helpfulness with the children in their
efforts to make gifts for all members of the family.

For years my husband had been urging me to move back to Old Mexico. He
had the idea that he could pick up where he had left off and make a better
living for both of his families. Louisa flatly refused to take her family
back there, so he kept urging me more and more.

My parents had returned to Old Mexico as soon as it was safe for them to
do so. The reports we got from them were far from encouraging, but my
husband would not change his mind. He was obsessed with this desire.

Whenever I needed anything new he would say, "Wait until we get back to
Mexico." I begged him to make a trip back there by himself and look
things over before uprooting the family, but he would not listen. He was
so sure that everything would be all right and that he could get things
lack as they were before we left.

One day, as I was washing clothes on my ragged old washboard, I tore my
hand. I turned to my husband and said, "See what I've done to my hand.
I must have a new washboard." It was the last straw when he calmly said,
"When we get back to Mexico I will buy you a new one." I realized then
that there was no use in my arguing any longer, so I answered him with,
"All right, let's go." He was really surprised and said it would take
time to get ready. I was at my wits end and did not give him a moment's
rest until we were on our way on this dreaded trip.

Soon after Pearl's first birthday we boarded the train. We stopped in
El Paso where we did some needed shopping for the children's clothes
and household articles we knew would be hard to get in Mexico. Money
was scarce so I divised a way to avoid paying duty on some of the new
purchases. I tied several pieces of new cloth to form a baby quilt and
wrapped the baby in it as we crossed the line into Mexico. I washed all
the new clothing we had bought or had the children wear them. Soon we
were on another train headed for Dublan. When the train arrived there
one thought of relief crossed my mind; I would never again have to hear
my husband say, "When we get to Mexico I will get it for you."
