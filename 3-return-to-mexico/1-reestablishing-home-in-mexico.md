**MEXICO -- 1917 to 1929
by her daughter Pearl Done Hill**

_On arriving in Dublan we went to Grandpa Moffeft's home where we had a
good hot meal and got warm. We lived there while Grandpa and Papa fought
to get our home back from the Mexicans who were living in it._

_After seeing how things really were and talking to several people, Papa
decided he would be real lucky if he could just get that one piece of
property back. He and Grandpa were going to Casas Grande to appeal to the
court there. Grandma decided to go with them. They were very thankful as
she knew the Mexican language so well and neither of them knew much of it._

_They got court orders and eviction papers for the Mexicans who were living
in our old house to vacate the property in just a few days._

_These Mexicans would not move. They just laughed at the papers and said
that they were worthless. Papa didn't know at this time, but later found
out that the Mexicans were being backed up in their actions by a 'good'
Brother in the town who wanted to get hold of that particular piece of
property._

_Papa didn't do anything until the morning after the day the Mexicans were
supposed to have moved. Early that morning he went to the new house he
had been building at the time of the Exodus. The Mexicans were using it
for a shelter for their animals. They had cows in one room, pigs in another 
and goats and chickens in the other two. He turned the animals into the
yard and started shoveling out the mess. The Mexicans ran into the street
and started screaming that a man was "throwing things out of their house,"
which wasn't true, as Papa had been very careful not to disturb the house
they were living in._

_All the Mexican neighbors came running and yelling. Grandpa came to see
what all the noise was about. One of the Mexicans rode his horse to the
Station, a little town about three miles south. He brought back a very
pompous, know-it-all policeman. Knowing hardly any of their language,
Papa and Grandpa had no idea what was being said. The policeman finally
told Papa that he was under arrest and would have to go with him. Papa
said he wouldn't go. The policeman hit him over the head with his sabre,
cutting a gash across his head and down one side through his ear. The
blow probably would have killed him had he not been wearing his heavy
felt hat. As it was it left him quite groggy and very bloody._

_The policeman prodded Papa and Grandpa with his sabre and made them walk.
They were just passing the Tithing Office when they met Grandma in her
buggy. She found out what was going on. The policeman wasn't going to
let her take care of Papa's wound, but Grandma set him straight about
that in a hurry. She bandaged Papa's head as best she could and got him
and Grandpa into the buggy. They all went to the Station. There Grandma
told the Jefe (head police officer) just what had happened. He was very
angry about it all. He was especially angry at the policeman, had him
whipped with a 'cat-o-nine tails' and demoted._

_He gave orders for the Mexicans to be moved off our property by sundown
of the next day or they would all be put in jail._

_It was a great relief to the whole family to finally see all the Mexicans,
their belongings and animals off our place. Everyone went to work cleaning
up. Mother moved into the two-room 'old house' and started right in
planting a garden, grapevines and fruit trees. Papa worked at finishing
the four-room brick house._

_Everything was a mess! The Mexicans had found the things Papa and Mama had
hidden before they left. The jars of fruit had been broken and strewn all
over the yard. Most of the furniture had been used for fire wood. What was
left was beyond repair. The farm implements were a total loss. Grandpa had
found the same conditions at his home when he returned. The only things
saved were what he had buried between the two straw stacks near his barn._

_After a spring and summer of very hard work, things started to look
decent again, and it wasn't too long before Papa had the brick house
ready for Mother. She was very happy to move into it and really get
settled._

_The children went to school that year in the Tithing Office, just
three blocks away from home. The Ward Chapel had burned down and the
Relief Society Hall, out on the prairie east of town, had been badly
torn up. By the next school year this Relief Society Hall had been
restored. It was much bigger than the Tithing Office, but a lot farther
from home. School and all our Church meetings and socials were held
there. It was a long way for Mother and her children to walk, but we
did it no matter what the weather._

_Those first years were filled with hard work, disappointments and fears.
So many times Mother found the calf or the little pigs or the chickens
stolen. Often she wouldn't have to milk the cows in the morning as that
chore had been done for her during the night. She knew who was doing
most of the thieving, but also knew that if she made a fuss about it
things could be much worse. The Mexicans were real nasty in their ways
of 'getting even'._

_Mother really feared them, and spent many sleepless nights praying for
the safety of her little family. She was alone with her children so
much of the time after getting settled in her new home, as Papa could
not find much work in Dublan. He went to El Paso or Tucson to work,
making short visits home at planting and harvesting times._

_Mother's brother Norman and his family were also living in Dublan at
that time. He and Grandpa built a boat. Once in a while all the relatives
would go to the lakes, about five miles east of town, for an all-day
picnic or a rare over-night stay. At these times that boat really got a
workout. Everyone enjoyed the boating, fishing and visiting together._

_Life went on fairly well for a while. Each day was filled with hard work
for Mother, Grandpa was so good to help her run the farm, but she had
the brunt of things and six children to care for besides. She trained
the older children to help quite a bit, which eased her load a little._

_In 1919 Mother had a bad miscarriage. She was ill for quite a while.
At that time Grandpa had a young Mexican man living at his home. His
name was Elias Luna. He was a deserter from Pancho Villa's army. Grandpa
had found him ragged, sick and hungry. He took him in and, in return,
Elias helped with the work. Grandpa sent him to do Mother's chores
while she was sick. This was a big help to her._

_That year Papa and Grandpa had raised a large crop of pinto beans. Our
share was stored in sacks in our old house. Mother was very happy
about them as she knew they could be sold to pay some debts and buy
some things that were much needed._

_One day Mother sent Elias to get a pan of beans to cook for supper. He
came running back. His poor face was pale and he was very upset. Mother
calmed him down and he was finally able to say, "No beans, no one,
all go." All those sacks of beans had been stolen. Papa knew right off
who had stolen them, but he also knew he could not prove it. That
instance showed him to what lengths the Mexicans would go to get even.
He had demanded rent payments from the Mexicans who were living in Aunt
Lizzie's old home and had it arranged legally, so he thought. The
Mexicans made one rent payment then stole the beans to get even. They
never paid any more rent either. Mother really felt badly about it as
the beans were worth many times the amount of that one rent payment._

_Grandpa also had another man living with them for a while. His name was
Walter Obeckson. He was a deserter from the United States Army under
General Pershing. He lived in constant fear of being found, returned
to the United States, and shot for desertion. His fears became so
great that he would hide every time the train came into town._

_Papa hired him to dig a well by the corral, so the animals could drink
there instead of having to be brought up to the house pump. Poor
Walter, whenever he would hear the train whistle he would jump into
the well and crouch there until he figured the train had gone. Mother
felt so sorry for him. One day she felt the urge to talk to him.
She asked him why he didn't go back and give himself up and explain
the circumstances that had caused his desertion. She pointed out how
horrible his life had become with his great fear eating at him all
the time. After thinking it over a short time, he went back and gave
himself up. Later Grandpa got a letter from him, saying he had been
fully pardoned. Mother was so happy that she had followed her urge
and had that talk with him._
