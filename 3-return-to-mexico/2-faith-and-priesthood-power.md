In the summer of 1920, when I was three and a half years old, I had a real bad case of scarlet fever. I was very near death, but the power of the Priesthood and Mother's great faith saved my life. I was just getting over that when I came down with double flu pneuminia. I was so near death that Grandma had given up. My father said, "This baby is not supposed to die." He administered to me and said I would get well. I went right to sleep and was much better when I woke up.

Mother was cooking a pot of beans. I smelled them and said, "Beans!" I really begged for some of them. Poor Mother, she was so afraid to give me any. Finally she felt that maybe just one might not hurt me. She put one bean and some of the soup in a spoon, showed it to me, then mashed the bean thoroughly and fed it to me. I was satisfied and went back to sleep.

There were so many times in Mother's life that her great faith and the power of the Priesthood worked miracles. I have never known anyone to have a stronger testimony of the Gospel, knowledge of the power of the Priesthood, and complete faith in God than my mother.

On April 9, 1921 my brother Horace was born. Mother was so very happy with her sandy haired little boy, even though he was a very frail, thin baby. She knew her prayers had been answered when everything went right at this time.

Not long after Horace was born, Leola came down with typhoid fever. She was very sick. Grandmother and Mother worked over her night and day. Mother was so thankful to have Grandmother there as she was a graduate of Nursing, Chiropractic and Osteopathic Schools. She was the only doctor in the town.

Leola had had several sieges before this typhoid, which had weakened her terribly. It was really a miracle of faith and prayer that pulled her through.

Leola's hair had always been very fine and thin. Mother didn't want to see her lose the little she had, so she rubbed warm olive oil and salt into her hair and scalp real often. Leola didn't lose her hair. There were three girls about her age who had typhoid at this same time. They all lost their hair and when theirs came back in it was curly. Leola felt quite bad that she hadn't lost hers.

When she started getting better she was so very hungry, but could have very little to eat for fear the fever would come back.

One day Mother caught a skunk that had been eating the eggs and little chickens. She had him by the hair of his tail, knowing that as long as she held him that way, not letting him get his front feet onto anything solid, he could not stink on her. She couldn't kill him herself without laying him down. She had to have help. She decided to carry the skunk to Grandpa's and have him kill it. She got Leola to promise not to get out of bed while she was gone. Leola's promise didn't last long. She got up and, holding onto chairs and tables, got to the stove where there was a pot of beans. She got a dish of them, skimmed the cream off a pan of milk, mixed them together and hurriedly ate them and got back into bed. Needless to say that meal almost cost her her life. Grandma had an awful time pulling her through.

While Mother was carrying that skunk over to Grandpa's the town bully came by in his Ford car. How he did laugh, slowing down to enjoy the - to him - comical sight. Mother said she was sorely tempted to throw the skunk into his car, but resisted. Some of us who had been teased unmercifully by this man really wished that she had.

One of Mother's greatest joys was to plant things and watch them grow. She really had a 'green thumb' and could make anything grow. She also had several hives of bees she dearly loved. Working with her plants and bees seemed to help her be able to stand the hard knocks she met in her life on every side.

When Ammon was nine years old, he was playing with two hammers. He pounded them together real hard to make them ring louder. A piece of steel flew off from one of them and entered one of his eyes. Grandmother tried her best to save the eye. When it looked like infection was setting in she took him to an eye doctor in El Paso. The eye could not be saved, but the doctor was able to save enough of the nerves and muscles so a glass eye could be fitted that moved like a real eye. Ammon was quite sick from the infection, the operation to remove his eye, and the shock of it all.

Mother had let Grandmother take him to El Paso as she knew she could take better care of him on the way there, while there, and on the way back home. But Mother's suspense and anxiety were hard for her to bear. Without her faith and God's help it would have been so very much worse. Ammon learned to manage his new eye very well and was really thankful for it.

On July 4, 1924, Mother's last child was born. It was a fine baby boy with lots of black hair, the only one of her children that wasn't born bald or with blond hair. The black hair didn't last long. He turned into a real towhead. Mother named him Owen Emmett, the only one of her children to have a middle name, which was her Mother's maiden name. When he was learning to talk we would ask him what his name was. He would answer, "Owen a mutt Done.' It sounded so cute to us that we all teased him this way until he finally grew to dislike his middle name, and still does.

Mother had been sick quite a bit during her pragnancy and the birth was long and hard. She was about worn out with it all and was looking forward to a little rest. When Owen was eight days old Mother was starting to sit up and was feeling better. Olive was eighteen years old then and a big help with the new baby and the other children.

Papa was home at this time as it was hay cutting and baling time. He had
a big load of baled hay on the wagon ready to take to town. Horace
wanted to go with him so badly, but Papa had several other errands to
do and didn't want to have to worry about a little boy. Horace ran out
into the road and tried to climb up the back wheel of the wagon. Papa
didn't see him at all. When the wagon started it threw Horace under
the back wheel which ran over his stomach. Luckily, his body was in
the wheel rut of the road or he would have been cut in two. Mother
always said that his guardian angel lifted that wheel a bit.

A neighbor was coming along the road just then and saw what had happened.
He called to Papa to stop. Papa came running back. picked Horace up and
carried him into the house. It was a terrible shock to Mother. Grandmother
was sent for and came immediately. Mother had no business out of bed, but
she got up and helped care for Horace. It was a long hard fight to get him
onto his feet again. Many prayers were said and many blessings were given
to him. Again our faith in God and all our prayers won out.

Horace wasn't very healthy at the time he was run over. He had had summer
complaint, then measles that had gone into his stomach. He was sick so
much of the time those first years of his life. One day his cousin,
Woodrow, who was a little older, came to see him. He looked at Horace
and said, "Aunt Nellie, that little boy isn't any good, why don't you
trade him for a new one?" Horace really looked like a little skinned bird.

The shock of this accident caused Mother's milk to dry up. Poor little
Owen about starved. Cow's milk didn't agree with him at all. Right away
a goat was found. Her milk seemed to be just what he needed, but the
milking became a family affair. She was really ornery. It took one to do
the milking, two to hold her head and one to be ready to grab the milk
bucket in case she kicked. She wouldn't give her milk down if we tied
her. Everyone was very happy when Owen could digest cow's milk and the
goat could be told goodbye.

It took several months for Mother to get her health back. She had had
too much at one time, even for her. She was so thankful for the help
Olive, Leola and Bernard gave her. Bernard was real good to do the
chores and all the outside work, but wasn't about to do the 'sissy'
work inside. This suited Mother fine as there were so many outside
jobs to be done and she wasn't able to do them. Reed had gone to
Texas to work for a while. The worry of him being away from home
and not hearing from him didn't do her any good.
