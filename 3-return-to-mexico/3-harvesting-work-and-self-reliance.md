_That winter all the children except Horace and Owen were in school.
Olive and Bernard rode the rickety old school bus to High School in
Juarez, eighteen miles away. Leola, Ammon and I walked the mile across
the prairie to school. Mornings were very busy. Bernard milked and
did the other chores, Olive put up the school lunches and, with the
help from the rest of us, managed to leave things pretty well in
order. Mother had I a little time during the day to just enjoy
Horace, her extra good little almost red-head, and Owen, her once
black-headed, but now towheaded baby._

_Spring, summer and autumn were very busy times. Spring brought the
garden and crop planting. Papa tried to be home at this time. When
he couldn't the brunt of the work fell on Mother, even though Grandpa
helped her all he could. Mother planted everything that would grow in
our climate. Her garden was her pride and joy. We children would watch
things grow and could hardly wait until they were big enough to eat._

_One spring she was planting some grape cuttings. Horace was watching her
and said, "But, Mama, they are just sticks." She told him to wait a
little and he would see how pretty the sticks would look. He didn't
have much patience as he was only three years old. He checked on
those 'sticks' several times a day. One day he came running to the house
calling, "Mama, Mama, see the sticks, they are all pretty." He had his
little hands full of the grape cuttings he had pulled up in his joy to
show her the tiny, new leaves._

_Summer was the time for canning and drying food for winter. Mother would
process any kind of fruit, vegetables and meat she could raise, trade
for or buy._

_Autumn was apple and corn time. Mother would buy a whole wagon load of
apples. She had an apple peeler that peeled, cored and sliced an apple
at the same time. I seemed to be the chief peeler as I was too young
to do much of the canning. Horace would stand on a stool and 'help' too._

_The corn was shucked then boiled. The kernels were cut off the cobs and
dried. Mother would scrape the cobs after the kernels were cut off,
getting all the rest of the kernels. She wouldn't think of letting
that much of the corn waste. Those scrapings made delicious creamed
corn and corn fritters. She never wasted anything. She even salvaged
the apple peelings and cores. These she would cook then press them
through a sieve, sweeten and season them. This made very good apple
butter._

_There was another 'member of the family' to be reckoned with whenever
green corn was brought into the house. Our old gray cat, a real family
pet, and the best mouser around, would start mewing. She would keep it
up, getting louder and more impatient, until someone husked and gave
her an ear. She would carry it to a corner and gnaw away, purring softly
to herself, until she had only the bare cob left. She also had another
'favorite food', One day Mother was kneading down a batch of bread dough.
The cat began to mew and tried to climb onto the table. Mother shooed
her away, reminding her that the table was forbidden territory to her.
Just then someone came to the door. Mother went to answer it, and when
she returned to the kitchen, old pussy-cat was in a corner munching
away on a piece of dough she had 'snitched' from the pan. She got her
piece of dough about every time we mixed bread after that._

_Early summer and autumn brought honey extracting time. This was a very
'sticky' time. Honey got all over everything and everybody. Mother very
seldom got stung. She loved the bees and they seemed to know it. The
rest of us got our share of stings, but the honey was worth it. It was
our main sweetening. Mother was an expert at cooking with it. Her honey
cake was a masterpiece._

_She always traded some of the honey for molasses so we would have a
little variety. Sometimes there would be extra honey to sell. The money
came in handy for other things we needed. Once in a while, but not often,
she would make out an order to Sears, Roebuck & Company. That was really
an event in our lives. The waiting for that package to arrive was almost
unbearable, as we knew there would always be a little treat for each of us._

_Mother made all of our bedding. Mattresses were made of ticking filled
with corn husks or wheat straw. Sheets were of unbleached muslin.
Pillow cases were made of flour sacks, and quilts from every scrap of
cloth she could get her hands on. She taught us all how to cut quilt
blocks when we were very young. As we got a little older, we learned
how to sew them together on the old 'treadle' sewing machine. She made
sure all three of her girls learned to quilt. Leola and I didn't like
it at all but we had to do our share._

_One time everyone had to work at bedding making real hard. The boys
were sleeping outside. They would roll their bedding up and leave it on
their cots in the daytime. One night they went out to go to bed. Reed
came back and asked Mother why she had brought their bedrolls in that
day. She hadn't brought them in so she knew they had been stolen._

_Mother was a genius at making a good meal out of practically nothing.
The way she could 'stretch' food was almost unbelievable, but it was
always delicious. Her bean rolls, fruit cobblers and homemade bread
were the best in town. Many times we could smell the fresh baked
bread before we got into the house from school. She would always
let us have some of it while it was still hot, and hot bread and
honey is one of our most cherished memories._

_Mother loved to do handwork. She could crochet anything without a
pattern. If she happened to see a piece of crochet work she liked,
she would look at it closely and be able to remember it and to make
it when she got time. She could cut out the fanciest doilies and
trimmings from paper, making birds, trees and flowers in them. At
Valentine time the trimmings on our homemade valentines were really
envied. She knew how to make beads out of crushed rose petals. She
would string the rose petal beads and tiny colored glass beads in
patterns. She had a beautiful necklace that Reed and Olive made for
her that way, as she taught us to do these things also. She was
always using odds and ends to make something pretty._

_One thing we all loved, and will always remember, was the large
blackboard she bought and hung on the kitchen wall. She always made
sure there was a supply of chalk._

_Money was very scarce. There was never enough even for the necessities,
but, somehow she managed to make birthdays and Christmas very special
and wonderful. For Christmas we would each get one main gift and two
or three little things in our sock. So many times we would find an
orange in the toe of our sock. That was an especially wonderful treat
as we hardly ever even saw an orange any other time. Nearly always
there was a big popcorn ball in the top of our sock._

_Birthdays always meant something made just for that very special
occasion. Often it was a honey cake with real frosting on it._

_Mother was one of the very few women who had a sink and pump right in
her kitchen. It made things so much easier and handier for her. Papa
did several things that way for her._
