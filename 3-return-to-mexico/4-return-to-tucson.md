The years passed with life going on with its ups and downs. There were
many more 'downs' than 'ups'. Something was always happening to upset
Mother and try her faith.

One day Bernard and some neighbor boys were in the boy's room. They
were playing with a real gun. They had assured Mother that it wasn't
loaded. She went on about her work. Soon she heard a shot, then complete
silence. She said that was the longest trip she ever took. Each step
was like an eternity, and each step was a prayer. When she realized that
the bullet hadn't hit any of the boys. she really said a prayer of
thanks, especially thanking their guardian angels who always seemed
overworked around our home. That gun and its young owner were sent
home in a hurry.

Olive finished High School and went to El Paso to work for a while.
Bernard wouldn't finish school. He left to find work in the United
States. He didn't bother to let Mother know where he was or what he
was doing. Reed was about as bad that way too. She really worried
about them and prayed for their welfare.

Leola was going to High School and liked it very much, especially when,
once in a while, she got to stay the whole week in Juarez with a
girlfriend, then come home on Friday evening. She got smart and missed
the bus on purpose so she could stay the weekend too. The second time
she did this Mother fooled her. She borrowed Grandpa's horse and buggy
and went after her. She didn't pull that trick again.

Ammon started High School but didn't care too much for it. He didn't
like to have to get up so early to catch the bus and to have to get
home so late in the evening.

There were never two happier little boys than Horace and Owen. The
Christmas of 1927 they each got a tricycle. They thought they must be
in Heaven. They were so cute and appreciative. They practically lived
on those trykes.

That winter Mother got to wondering just what the future had in store
for her. Papa was gone from home more and more. Reed and Bernard were
gone. Olive was teaching school at home that winter, but Mother knew
she would leave again soon for something better. Leola was already
expressing her desire to leave. Mother realized that it wouldn't be
too many years before she would be left alone. She was very tired of
the whole responsibility of the farm, the fear of the Mexicans and the
constant thieving. She knew that if a change was made she would have
to make it. In the spring she started that change.

She talked it over with her father and mother. They were also discouraged
with their life in Dublan and wanted to leave. They all decided to
make the big break. Grandpa made a deal with a good man he knew, Seville
Hatch. If Brother Hatch would take Mother and her children to Tucson,
Arizona, come back and get them and take them to Mesa, Arizona, he could
have Grandpa's Ford car. Everyone was happy with the deal.

Mother got in touch with Reed and he promised to have a house ready
for us. We couldn't take much with us as the car could only pull a
small trailer.

Mother almost got cheated out of her place by a would-be good Brother.
Happily a really good Brother stepped in and saw to it that Mother got
her money.

We left Dublan June 30, 1928. We were really a sight. We looked like
the Joad family in the motion picture "The Grapes of Wrath". The trailer
was packed as full as possible, and the car was full of people. There
were seven of us. Brother Hatch, Mother, Leola, Ammon, Horace, Owen
and me. Olive had left home earlier and was in Tucson.

Mother felt so bad at having to leave so many things that meant so much
to her and all of us, but there was nothing else she could do. It was
so pitiful to have to leave the little boys' trykes, they were
broken-hearted, but not as broken-hearted as Mother was for them.

That trip was really something. It took five days when it should have
taken only a little over two. I don't know how Mother stood it. We
hadn't gone many miles when we had our first flat tire. After that
it seemed we had one regularly every few miles, and each one was
blessed in loud profanity by our driver. He was a good man but very
rough and outspoken.

The distance we made that first day should have been made in three or
four hours.

We camped out at night. Mother tried to keep things nice and orderly.
We all prayed for no rain. Our prayers were answered, there wasn't
even a shower the whole trip.

At the end of the second day, Brother Hatch was so disgusted he swore
he was going to turn around and go back to Dublan the next morning.
Mother really prayed for his heart to be softened as she had nothing
to go back to. God heard her prayers and answered them, as nothing more
was said about going back and, for the rest of the trip, Brother Hatch
was much quieter and better-natured.

When we got to Deming, New Mexico, Mother bought a coconut for a special
treat and thanked us for being such good children. We had never seen a
coconut, so it was really special to us and. we all enjoyed chewing
on our share of it.

Mother was so happy and relieved when we got to Tucson and found the
way to our new home at 903 East Seventh Street. Reed was waiting for
us and was so glad we had finally arrived.
