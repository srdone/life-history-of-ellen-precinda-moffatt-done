_It was the Fourth of July and Owen's birthday. Reed took us all to
the big stadium at the University of Arizona to see the fireworks.
After several of them had been set off, Owen jumped up, clapped his
hands and yelled, "Everybody came to my birthday." Bless his little
heart, he thought it was all for him, and Mother let him think so._

_Mother enjoyed that home. It had room enough for all of us and inside
plumbing besides. The kitchen range had a big hot water tank attached
to it. All the hot running water she needed was really a luxury to her._

_One of the first things she bought was a Maytag washing machine. She
had always had to wash clothes on a scrub board and carry her water.
The washer made washday almost fun._

_The soil wasn't very good in the back yard, but Mother planted a garden
anyway, and, somehow, made it grow. Her 'green thumb' was always working
for her._

_Papa and Olive joined the family right away, making it complete except
for Bernard._

_The school and Church were both only a few blocks from our home. For
that, Mother was very thankful. No more long walks across the prairie
that was so hot in the summer and so cold and windy in the winter._

_Things went smoothly until the next spring. My father was seventy-six
years old, but was holding down a good paying carpenter job. He could
keep up with the younger men and do his job perfectly, too. He always
took great pride in work of any kind and especially his carpenter work._

_He was happy to be able to earn good wages to support his families. His
boss had been quite skeptical about hiring him on account of his age, but
after father's first day on the job, the boss was more than happy with him._

_Father rode a bicycle to work and everywhere else he went, as we had no
car. One Sunday he rode his bicycle to Binghampton to visit his second
wife, Louisa. He told Mother he would be back in the late afternoon.
When evening came and he wasn't home, Mother called Aunt Louisa to see
what time he had left there. On finding that he had left in plenty of
time to have been home earlier, Reed called the Police. They found
Papa where a car had knocked him into some shrubbery along the side of
the road. His mangled bicycle was beside him. He was unconscious and
badly hurt. They rushed him to the hospital, then got in touch with
Mother. Reed took her to the hospital. Papa was unconscious for several
days. The tendons in his right shoulder were badly pulled, as the door
handle of the car that hit him had caught him in the elbow, throwing
him, his bicycle and the door handle off the road._

_It was lucky the door handle broke off as that is how the police found
the hit-run driver. He was a young boy who had already been in trouble
with the police. His father was quite wealthy and offered to pay all of
Papa's expenses plus a settlement if Papa wouldn't press charges, which
would have been a mess and the boy would have had to go to prison.
Neither Papa or Mother wanted that, so the settlement was made._

_Papa was really sick for quite some time. Aunt Lizzie came as soon as
possible to help care for him. For this Mother was very grateful as she
was a nurse._

_It was quite a while before he was up again. His arm never was too much
use to him after this, but he managed real well with it. I remember
him sitting on the front porch so much of the time that summer. It
seemed so strange to see him just sitting as he had always been so active._
