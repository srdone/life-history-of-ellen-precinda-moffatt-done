_Reed decided to sell his part of the business he was in and try
something else. He left Tucson. Right away Papa and Mother decided to
take the settlement money and move to Mesa._

_They made arrangements for a house in Mesa and a big truck to move us.
Mother was able to take everything with her, even the kitchen stove._

_We got to Mesa in the afternoon. There was something wrong about the
deal that had been made for a house, so they hurried and found a
building lot. Everything was quickly unoladed onto the ground as the
truck driver had to get back to Tucson._

_It was late, so after supper and prayers, in which thanks was given
for a clear night, we all went to bed as best we could. Just before
morning we got a real rain storm. Everything we had was soaked. The
next day was a clear hot one. Papa bought a big tent and, as fast
as the sun dried our things, we moved into it. The wood stove was
set up outside where it did a good job of cooking._

_About the first thing Mother did was start a fall garden. She went
to a nursery to get asparagus roots. The man really laughed at her,
telling her she could no way grow asparagus in Mesa. She ignored his
almost sarcastic remarks and got the address of a place to send for
them. Her asparagus bed was a wonderful success. We often tried to
get her to take some of the stalks to the nursery and show that man,
but she wouldn't._

_Real soon after we were settled in the tent. Papa arranged for a home
to be built. It was to be a six-room cement block house. Papa and
Ammon helped all they could with the work, but most of it was done
by hired help._

_We moved into it before all the windows and doors were in. We were
quite crowded, but it was heaven after the tent. Mother was so happy
to have a kitchen again. We still had the 'outhouse' as the bathroom
wasn't finished yet. The money had run out and the finishing had to
be done a very little at a time._

_Leola stayed in Tucson where she had a good job with the Telephone
Company. She was rooming with some good friends, but Mother was
worried about her and asked her to please come home. She didn't
want to, but she finally made arrangements to be transferred to
Mesa. She came about two months after we did. Olive finished her
job in Tucson and came soon after Leola._

_The winter of 1929-1930 was very cold. The only room that had any
heat was the kitchen. It was really crowded when we were all in it,
and to make things worse, Aunt Louisa decided to come and spend
some time working in the Temple._

_It rained a lot that winter. The first flat roof on the house leaked
like a sieve and was always having to be patched, but was never free
from leaks._

_Ammon, Horace, Owen and I were all in school. It was Owen's first
year. He came home the first day really angry and disgusted, saying
he wasn't going back to school ever again. Mother talked to him and
calmed him down. He finally said he wasn't going back to school cause
his teacher talked baby talk, "She called me Owen 'done'."_

_In the spring of 1930 Bernard came through Mesa. He stayed only a few
days. Mother was so glad to see him and to know that he was all right.
He went on to San Francisco and started working at house painting. He
stayed with that trade the rest of his working years, and was much
better about keeping in touch with Mother which was a big relief and
joy to her._

_Money was very scarce those first years in Mesa. Papa wasn't able to
work and spent most of his time at the Temple. He would invite
relatives and friends home for a meal or to stay a while if they
needed to while they were working in the Temple. This made it very
hard for Mother. She never complained, just did the best she could
and stretched the food a little farther._

_Olive and Leola were both working. Their wages kept everything going.
I did quite a lot of babysitting and housecleaning for pennies. Horace
and Owen did their bit too. They would go to the produce sheds and get
whatever was free, lettuce, carrots and mainly cantaloupes. They would
come home with their little red wagon loaded. Sometimes they would
sell some of the cantaloupes on their way home. Sometimes they would
bring a big chunk of ice from the Ice House near the sheds. We all
really enjoyed cold water then._

_Those two boys got along pretty well together even though they were of
entirely different natures. Horace could make up his mind quickly and
wanted to get things done fast. Owen was very slow. Sometimes Horace
would get so exasperated he would yell at Owen to "come on and quit
being so darn slow". Owen made his quiet slowness pay off with the
elderly women of the neighborhood. He would sit on their porches and
let them talk to him all they wanted. He always got cookies or other
goodies for his trouble. Horace envied the cookies, etc., but had no
patience with the way they were earned._

_Mother had a real knack about finding where she could get fruit, corn
and potatoes for the picking. As we had no car, we all walked many miles
to get the free food. When the places were too far to walk, Mother
would somehow find a ride with friends or neighbors._

_She was always happy about the two big fig trees in front of the house
and the smaller one in the back. Those two trees really put on the fruit,
plenty to be eaten raw with enough left to fill jars and jars with jam
and preserves. Often she would dry a lot of them, especially when sugar
was scarce._

_Soon the fruit trees and grape vines she had planted were bearing
fruit. One Santa Rosa plum tree really put out the fruit every year.
It bore faithfully for over sixteen years. In later years Mother
always referred to it as her 'Sweet Sixteen' tree._

_Aunt Lizzie spent a lot of time with us. She loved to work in the
Temple. We all loved her very much, she was so kind and gentle. When
we children were quarreling and saying cross words to each other,
she wouldn't get after us, or even say anything to us. She would
start singing "Let us Oft Speak Kind Words to Each Other" or "Love
at Home". Those songs stopped many a quarrel and shamed us more than
any amount of scolding could have done._

_Grandpa and Grandma had built a small home about three blocks from
us, and two blocks from the Temple. Mother was very glad to be near
her parents again, and was especially glad to know they could do
all the Temple work they wanted to._
