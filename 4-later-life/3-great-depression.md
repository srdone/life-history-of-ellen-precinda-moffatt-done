We heard plenty about the 'horrible depression' of the thirties, but
we were so poor anyway that it didn't affect our lives at all. We
were the lucky ones. We had no adjustments to make as did the people
who were used to a lot more and, all of a sudden, could no longer
have luxuries, but just the bare necessities.

Several times Mother rented the front room to Temple workers for a few
months at a time. It really cramped us, but every penny was needed.

Our first two or three Christmases in Mesa were very lean. Just a
few little extras could be afforded. One Christmas Owen had just
eleven cents. He was determined to give everyone at home a little
present. He bought a five cent package of bobby pins and divided
it between Olive, Leola and me. A three cent spool of thread went
to Mother. A two cent package of rubber lands was for Horace, and
two pieces of foil-wrapped 'chocolate money' (two for a penny), one
each for Papa and Ammon, made the rounds. We were all so proud of
him and his thoughtfulness and ability to make eleven cents go so far.

In the early spring of 1933, Reed brought his new wife, Reina, to
Mesa. They had been married in Los Moches, Mexico, on November 16, 1931. Mother opened the home to them. They lived in the front bedroom.
Reed went to work for the W.P.A. He was determined to get a home of
his own as soon as possible.

Mother was so very happy that Reed was married and settled down, as
he had been such a wanderer. She learned to dearly love Reina.

Leola married Osborne L. Hutchinson, March 25, 1933, They lived with
his folks for a while then moved into a home of their own.

Leola knew that the money she had been giving Mother would be missed
very much, so she gave her a little whenever she could.

In the fall of this year, Mother started having trouble with her
female organs. She needed to have them removed, but wouldn't consent
to the operation. She had such faith in her mother's ability to cure
her ailment and wanted to give her every chance to do so. She would
swell all up then hemorrhage and almost bleed to death before the
bleeding could be stopped.

She was having a real bad spell when Reed's baby was born December 8, 1933. Reina had a horrible time having that baby. Grandmother delivered
it. Her great wisdom, experience and faith in the Lord, plus many
prayers said by Mother, saved Reina and her baby boy. They named him
Reed Elmer.

Mother felt very bad that she was unable to help at all. Grandmother
was very thankful for the help Olive gave her. No one thought any of
the rest of us were old enough to help.

Reed bought a lot just through the block from Mother. He made his
own adobes and started his house in the spring of 1934. They moved
into it before it was even half finished. Reina was so happy to
finally have a home of her own, and Mother was happy for them and
to have them so close by.

Olive was working in the office at the Temple. Her pay was the
mainstay of the family. Horace and Owen did all the odd jobs they
could find. Leola lied about my age and got me on at the Telephone
Company where I worked after school and on Saturdays.

Mother was still having a lot of trouble with hemorrhaging. She still
had faith that Grandma could take care of everything and would not
consent to an operation.

On June 15, 1934, Ammon married Goldie Pember. They had the wedding
at Mother's and rented an apartment quite close by.

The house really seemed big with just Mother, Olive, Horace, Owen
and me. It had always been so full of people. Mother had cut way down
on the visiting Temple workers, as she didn't feel right about having
her children support them. Papa was spending most of his time in Provo
and Salt Lake City with Aunt Lizzie and some of their children.

On September 30, 1934 I married William Edward Hill. Papa came to the
wedding. Mother and I were both glad of that. He stayed quite a while
to be with Mother as he was worried about her failing health.

In June of 1935 Papa's family held a Reunion in Mesa to celebrate his
sixtieth wedding anniversary with his first wife, Aunt Lizzie. We met
a lot of relatives, from Utah and other distant places, for the first
time. It was an occasion enjoyed by all.

On October 10, 1935, I had a stillborn baby girl. Mother was sick in
bed, so Edward, Olive and Leola took the baby home for her to see.
The Bishop, Isaac Dana, had said it would do no good to name her, but
Papa felt that it would. He named her Pearl. Mother felt better at
having her named. I was so glad to have both my parents feel that it
was the right thing to do.

Leola was about five months' pregnant at this time. She got the flu and
was terribly sick. She stayed at Mother's and Grandma was with her
most of the time. She saved Leola's and the unborn baby's lives. Leola
got so low that she was afraid that she would slip away if someone
didn't hold her hand. Papa sat for hours holding her hand and praying
for her. Through Grandma's faith, loving care, Papa's prayers and his
great faith in the power of the Priesthood, Leola lived through this
sickness and had a lovely baby girl, born February 25, 1936.

Soon after this Mother had to be operated on to save her life. She was
hemorrhaging badly and Grandma was not able to stop it. They found
a large fibroid tumor that was causing all the trouble. She never
could have gotten well as long as that tumor was there. It took her
quite a while to recover, but she finally got back to her normal,
healthy self, for which we were all very thankful.

THESE NEXT INSTANCES IN HER LIFE WERE WRITTEN BY MOTHER.

My husband was spending this winter, 1937, in Salt Lake City with his
first wife, Lizzie. Their children had rented a small apartment for
them, across the street, west, from the Temple, so they could do
Temple work.

They enjoyed this work until June of that year when, one morning as
he was waiting in line to get a name for the session, someone
accidently pushed against him, knocking him down. He broke his hip
and hit his head, causing him to become unconscious. He lived seven
or eight days, but never regained consciousness.

The Temple Authorities notified his son, Heber, in Provo, who fixed
a bed in the back of his truck and took his father to Provo to the
home of a daughter, Eva, where he passed away on June 13, 1937- My
daughter Olive and I went to Provo for his funeral.

I felt that the funeral was very nice, as arranged by Lizzie's
children, but was disappointed that they had the burial in the Provo
City Cemetery, as he had always said he wanted to be buried beside
his parents, grandmother, and his two infant sons in the Done Family
Plot in Payson City Cemetery.

Lizzie's son Bob drove up from Mesa and we came back with them. We
stopped at Jacob's Lake in the Kiabab Forest for our dinner. It was
so beautiful! Olive and I went for a walk among the pines. We saw a
Kiabab Squirrel a little ahead of us so we stopped and stood very
still to see what it would do. It came so close to us we could have
touched it, passed us and ran into the cafe. over a table or two and
out the window on the other side.

This was the first and only Kiabab Squirrel I ever saw, but I will
never forget its beautiful black fur with white on the under side of
its long. bushy tail. They say these large squirrels are found only
in the Kiabab Forest, and that they are protected by law, as there are
not very many of them even there. All the employees at Jacob's Lodge
are careful not to frighten them, so they often run in and out of the
cafe and gift shop, sometimes almost becoming a nuisance.

My husband's death left an empty, lonesome spot in my heart, but I
knew he had lived a good and useful life, true to his family and
friends and faithful to all of the teachings of the Church. It was
a comfort to me to know he passed away peacefully without having to
linger in pain and suffering over a long period of time.

February 25, 1936 brought me my first granddaughter, Leola's sweet
little towhead. They named her Nathel. She was a very delicate baby
because of Leola's serious spell of flu during her pregnancy, but she
soon began to grow and get stronger.

Two months later, April 11, 1936, Ammon's little boy David was born.
He really had a hard time getting here. His little head took a long
time to straighten out from its lopsided shape caused by his difficult
birth. His mother, Goldie, was bedfast for quite a while before she
could get over the damage caused her by this birth. We were all
thankful when things got back to normal and to know that little David
had no brain damage or any other bad affects.

Lizzie, who had been with her son Bob and family, in Mesa, since our
husband's death, suffered a stroke this same spring, which left her
helpless. She was unconscious for several days. Her daughter, May,
came from El Paso, Texas to help care for her. When she regained
consciousness she refused to eat anything. One afternoon I was out
in my garden and noticed a few shoots of asparagus. It was really
too late in the season to pick, but I remembered, how fond she was
of it, so I picked all I could find and took it over to Bob's. From
the first bite, she smacked her lips, enjoying every bite. For the
next few weeks, until she was well enough to be moved, I took all
the asparagus I could find to her. She never refused it, but ate it 
all with relish. This gave me another reason to be glad I had planted
it even though the man at the nursery had told me I couldn't grow
it in Mesa.

May took her mother to El Paso and cared for her until her death in
July of 1938.

Lizzie had always been the one to wait on and care for everyone else,
and her life was one of true service to her family and fellowmen. It
was hard for her to realize she could not care even for herself and
would have to be waited on the rest of her life. Though we all missed
her we were thankful she did not have to linger in this condition more
than a few months.

PEARL CONTINUES:

In the spring of 1936, Reina had a bad miscarriage, losing twin girls.
She had climbed on a stool to be able to reach the grape vines in
her arbor and tie them up into place. The stool slipped, she fell
causing the miscarriage. She was very sick through it all. Mother was
with her most of the time. She felt so sorry for Reed and Reina for
the loss of those two babies. Their main grief was the fact that
Reina could never have any more children.

On June 22, 1936, Bernard married Margaret Ruth Allee. Mother was so
happy that he had finally found a mate and would have a true home.
He had worked up a good paint contracting business in Daly City,
California.

On September 4, 1937, Leola had another little towheaded girl. Things
had gone well with her during this pregnancy and birth for which we
were all very thankful. They named the baby Ann. Later Patricia was
added to it and she was called Patty. She was a healthy, very happy
baby. It seemed so nice for Mother to finally get a grandchild without
so much trouble and misery for the mother.

On October 9, 1937, Goldie had a baby girl who came into the world
without much trouble. She was named Peggy Jean. She was a beautiful,
happy baby.

The next year Mother went to work at Deseret Industries. Oilve moved
into an apartment quite close to the Temple. She wanted to have a
little bit of a life of her own. She still helped mother moneywise.
Leola and Reed were good to help her that way also.

On October 2, 1939, Goldie had a baby boy. He was a fine-looking little
fellow. They named him Richard Vernon. Mother started thinking that
maybe she would be blessed with a lot of grandchildren after all.

Ammon and family moved to San Francisco where work was better. Olive
moved to Santa Monica, California where she went to work as a fitter
in a dress shop.

Horace and Owen were still at home. Horace had finished High School,
was working and anxious to be on his own, Owen was still in High
School and working at any part-time job he could find.

Mother's work at Deseret Industries wasn't very pleasant. She had to
walk two miles to work and two miles home every day. She loved
walking and enjoyed looking at the miracles of nature along the
way. However, many times she was very weary before she got home.
At these times I imagine she would wish that one of the miracles of
nature could have been a stout pair of wings for her.

She had to cope with the tyranny of her 'dear' cousin, Clara Emmett,
who was her boss. Clara was a very bossy, know-it-all person who,
for some reason seemed to like to make life miserable for Mother.

Mother never complained, but went on with her work in her quiet,
efficient way. Often she managed to really show Clara up in her
true light. The other women were delighted when this happened as
they all disliked Clara as a boss also. Mother kept this job until
the summer of 1941.
