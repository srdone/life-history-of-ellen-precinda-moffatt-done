####Foreword for new edition

Nellie's life history has been a wonderful gift in my life.
I have many memories of my father, Brent Done (Nellie's
great-grandson), reading it to me as a child. The stories
related herein give me strength to overcome challenges and
trials and, in addition to the scriptures, have been a
key source of faith and hope in my life.

I have had the original book scanned into my computer for many
years, and I am glad that I finally am able to
publish it in a way that will be accessible to other
members of my family and to my children. I hope that the
stories of Nellie's life will continue to give strength
and hope to generations.

There are many miracles related within these pages, and I
have seen many miracles in my own life as well. But these
miracles are not the source of my faith, nor are they for
any true follower of Jesus Christ. Miracles serve to
give us reason to learn of Him, but by themselves
are not enough to convert us to His Gospel. The greatest
miracle that any one of us can experience, and the only one
that has any power to produce lasting faith, is the change
that submitting our wills to our Savior Jesus Christ produces
in our hearts. He is mighty to save and is the prince of peace.
He changes our hearts and helps us to become more than we
can ever hope to be alone. Nellie knew this, and lived her
life by the word of the Lord. May all who read her story
desire to experience the same power in their lives.
