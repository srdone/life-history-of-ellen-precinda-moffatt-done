#####MOTHER
God gave you, Mother dear,  
A gift of love,  
To bless our motal homes  
With happiness.  
Your touch so soft,  
Your voice  
So soothing, kind,  
Gave comfort, cheer.  

We offer you this gift,  
Your story, true.  
Our prayer: that it will bless  
Your growing clan;  
Help them reach out  
And give,  
As you gave all,  
True service, love.  

We know you're happy now  
With family, friends,  
Who met you joyously.  
Await us there;  
We'll carry on,  
Stay true  
To self, to God,  
Then be with you.
